- sitosterol (β-sitosterol) is one of the most abundant [[phytosterols]] found widely in plants, nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, fruits, and legumes. structurally similar to cholesterol, sitosterol is known for its cholesterol-lowering properties and beneficial effects on prostate health, inflammation, and immune modulation
- ## chemical properties
	- chemical formula: C₂₉H₅₀O
	- molecular weight: 414.71 g/mol
	- solubility: insoluble in water; soluble in fats, oils, and organic solvents
	- melting point: approximately 136–140°C
	- structure: steroid structure closely related to cholesterol with minor differences in side-chain
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- effectively reduces [[ldl cholesterol]] levels by blocking cholesterol absorption in the intestines, significantly lowering [[cardiovascular disease]] risk
	- widely used for managing symptoms of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] ([[bph]]) and promoting [[prostate health]]
	- demonstrates [[anti-inflammatory]] effects, beneficial in conditions such as [[arthritis]] and [[autoimmune disorders]]
	- studied for [[anticancer]] potential, particularly against breast, prostate, and colon cancers
- ## [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- sitosterol shows antimicrobial effects through immune enhancement, inflammation reduction, and direct inhibition of microbial growth and biofilm formation
	- bacteria:
		- [[staphylococcus aureus]]
		- [[escherichia coli]]
		- [[pseudomonas aeruginosa]]
	- fungi:
		- [[candida albicans]]
