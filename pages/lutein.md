alias:: xanthophyll

- [[lutein]], also known as xanthophyll, is a naturally occurring, oxygenated [[carotenoids]] essential for human [[eye health]]. it is concentrated primarily in the [[macula]] and [[retina]] of the human eye, acting as a potent antioxidant that filters harmful blue light, protecting ocular tissues from oxidative stress and reducing the risk of [[age-related macular degeneration (AMD)]], [[cataracts]], and [[retinal damage]].
- ## chemical properties
	- molecular weight: 568.87 g/mol
	- density: approximately 1.0 g/cm³
	- melting point: 190–193°C
	- solubility: soluble in fats, oils, and organic solvents; insoluble in water
	- optical rotation: +34° to +38° (in ethanol)
	- chemical formula: C₄₀H₅₆O₂
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- lutein is widely used as a dietary supplement to support and enhance [[visual health]], significantly reducing the incidence and progression of [[AMD]] and [[cataracts]].
	- its strong antioxidant properties protect skin cells from UV-induced oxidative stress, reducing signs of [[skin aging]] and improving [[skin hydration]]
	- lutein supplementation supports cognitive health, potentially reducing the risk of cognitive decline and neurodegenerative conditions such as [[dementia]] and [[alzheimer’s disease]].
	- lutein also plays a role in strengthening [[immune response]], enhancing overall health and resistance to oxidative damage.
	- [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- lutein exhibits antimicrobial effects primarily through potent antioxidant activity and immune system modulation, thereby enhancing the body’s defenses against microbial infections.
