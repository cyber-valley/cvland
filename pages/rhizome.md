- rhizome guilds are mixable and [[high margin]] multi layer system
- to reach retail-scale, continuous micro-supply, your minimum efficient guild unit should be 6–8 are (600–800 m²) of mixed rhizomes, this allows:
	- 7+ species
	- drying batch capacity
	- simple harvest-labor rhythm
	- enough biomass for branding/packaging work
