- the tone
	- wild
	- sacred
	- nature-first
	- glowing / mystical

- holders of tone:
	- founders
	- guardians
	- retreat leaders
	- key early guests
	- long-term partners
	- visual media: photographers, filmmakers
- things to avoid
	- chasing too cheap market too early
	- letting cheap “budget tour” companies push clients
	- overloading sinwood beyond sacred feeling
	- allowing too many cars, noise
	- low-quality parties
	- poor signage / poor visual brand
	- letting guides slip into “taxi driver” attitude
	- letting locals sell “cheap” versions around the valley (hard)
- practical steps:
	- make guardians the culture holders — they teach new guides
	- always approve visual media — don’t allow ugly mass promotion
	- cap volume in sacred zones
	- price & filter to keep respectful guests as majority
	- keep desa share strong — protect sacredness
	- grow storytelling capacity — guides, signage, materials
