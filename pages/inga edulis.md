- ### review of inga edulis
	- [[inga edulis]], commonly known as ice cream bean or guabo, is a [[leguminous]] tree native to the tropical regions of central and south america. it is valued for its multiple uses, including [[food]], [[timber]] , [[medicine]], and its role in [[permaculture]] systems.
- #### parts of the plant and their uses
	- **root**: inga edulis roots are known for their ability to fix [[nitrogen]] in the soil, which improves soil [[fertility]] . they are also used in [[traditional medicine]] for their [[anti-inflammatory]] properties.
	- **stem**: the stem of inga edulis provides strong and durable [[timber]] that is used for construction, making [[furniture]] , and crafting various wooden items. the [[wood]] is also a good source of [[fuel]] when dried.
	- **fruit**: the [[fruit]] of inga edulis is a long pod containing [[sweet]], [[edible]] pulp around the seeds. the pulp is consumed fresh and is a popular snack in regions where the tree grows.
	- **leaf**: inga edulis leaves can be used as green [[manure]] or [[mulch]] , enriching the [[soil]] with [[nitrogen]] and [[organic]] matter. they are also used in [[traditional medicine]] to [[treat]] various ailments.
	- **bark**: the bark has [[medicinal]] properties and is used in traditional remedies to treat skin conditions and digestive issues.
	- **flower**: the flowers of inga edulis are not commonly used directly for any products but are important for attracting pollinators, which helps maintain biodiversity in the ecosystem.
- #### uses of inga edulis
	- **plants/fruits**: the [[edible fruit]] pulp is sweet and often eaten fresh. it is also used in desserts and beverages.
	- **plants/greens**: leaves can be used as green [[manure]] to improve soil quality.
	- **plants/timber**: the wood is durable and used for various construction purposes and making [[furniture]] .
	- **plants/medicine**: different parts of the tree, including roots, leaves, and bark, are used in [[traditional medicine]] .
	- **plants/fuel**: the wood is a good source of [[firewood]] .
	- **plants/fertilizer**: the leaves, when decomposed, add valuable [[nutrients]] to the soil, improving [[fertility]] .
- #### data
	- **sun requirements**: inga edulis requires full sun to thrive.
	- **water requirements**: it prefers moist, well-drained soils and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods.
	- **soil ph**: it grows best in slightly acidic to neutral soils, with a ph range of 5.5 to 7.0.
	- **plant/roles in permaculture guilds**: inga edulis plays a vital role in [[permaculture]] systems due to its [[nitrogen-fixing]] ability, which enriches the soil and benefits neighboring plants. it also provides shade, which can be useful for underplanting [[shade-tolerant]] species, and its fallen leaves contribute to organic matter and soil [[fertility]] . its flowers [[attract pollinators]] , supporting [[biodiversity]] in the guild.
	- **height in meters**: inga edulis can grow up to 30 meters tall, although it is often found at heights of 15-20 meters.
	- **spacing in meters**: trees should be spaced about 8-10 meters apart to allow sufficient room for growth and root expansion.
	- **germination days**: seeds typically germinate in 7-10 days under optimal conditions.
	- **strata**: inga edulis is considered an overstory tree in agroforestry systems, providing [[canopy]] cover and [[shade]] .
	- **days to maturity**: it takes about 3-4 years for inga edulis trees to start bearing fruit.
	- **plant, harvest, pruning calendar in months**
		- planting: is best done at the beginning of the [[rainy season]] to ensure adequate water for establishment.
		- pruning: can be done annually to maintain the desired shape and promote healthy growth.
		- harvesting of the fruit occurs in the [[dry season]] , typically several months after flowering.
	- **good neighbors**: inga edulis grows well with other [[nitrogen-fixing trees]], [[fruit trees]] , and [[shade-tolerant]] crops. it is often used in agroforestry systems with [[cacao]] , [[coffee]] , and various fruit trees like [[banana]] and [[citrus]] .
	- **bad neighbors**: it should not be planted with crops that require full sunlight for optimal growth, as its dense [[canopy]] can create too much shade.
