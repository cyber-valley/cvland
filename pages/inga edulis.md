- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inga_edulis)
- inga edulis, commonly known as ice cream bean or guabo, is a leguminous tree native to the tropical regions of central and south america. it is valued for its multiple uses, including food, timber, medicine, and its role in permaculture systems.
- #### parts of the plant and their uses
	- **root**: inga edulis roots are known for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil, which improves soil fertility. they are also used in traditional medicine for their anti-inflammatory properties.
	- **stem**: the stem of inga edulis provides strong and durable timber that is used for construction, making furniture, and crafting various wooden items. the wood is also a good source of fuel when dried.
	- **fruit**: the fruit of inga edulis is a long pod containing sweet, edible pulp around the seeds. the pulp is consumed fresh and is a popular snack in regions where the tree grows.
	- **leaf**: inga edulis leaves can be used as green manure or mulch, enriching the soil with nitrogen and organic matter. they are also used in traditional medicine to treat various ailments.
	- **bark**: the bark has medicinal properties and is used in traditional remedies to treat skin conditions and digestive issues.
	- **flower**: the flowers of inga edulis are not commonly used directly for any products but are important for attracting pollinators, which helps maintain biodiversity in the ecosystem.
- #### uses of inga edulis
	- **plants/fruits**: the edible fruit pulp is sweet and often eaten fresh. it is also used in desserts and beverages.
	- **plants/greens**: leaves can be used as green manure to improve soil quality.
	- **plants/timber**: the wood is durable and used for various construction purposes and making furniture.
	- **plants/medicine**: different parts of the tree, including roots, leaves, and bark, are used in traditional medicine.
	- **plants/fuel**: the wood is a good source of firewood.
	- **plants/fertilizer**: the leaves, when decomposed, add valuable nutrients to the soil, improving fertility.
- #### data
	- **sun requirements**: inga edulis requires full sun to thrive.
	- **water requirements**: it prefers moist, well-drained soils and requires regular watering, especially during dry periods.
	- **soil ph**: it grows best in slightly acidic to neutral soils, with a ph range of 5.5 to 7.0.
	- **plant/roles in permaculture guilds**: inga edulis plays a vital role in permaculture systems due to its nitrogen-fixing ability, which enriches the soil and benefits neighboring plants. it also provides shade, which can be useful for underplanting shade-tolerant species, and its fallen leaves contribute to organic matter and soil fertility. its flowers attract pollinators, supporting biodiversity in the guild.
	- **height in meters**: inga edulis can grow up to 30 meters tall, although it is often found at heights of 15-20 meters.
	- **spacing in meters**: trees should be spaced about 8-10 meters apart to allow sufficient room for growth and root expansion.
	- **germination days**: seeds typically germinate in 7-10 days under optimal conditions.
	- **strata**: inga edulis is considered an overstory tree in agroforestry systems, providing canopy cover and shade.
	- **days to maturity**: it takes about 3-4 years for inga edulis trees to start bearing fruit.
	- **plant, harvest, pruning calendar in months**
		- planting: is best done at the beginning of the rainy season to ensure adequate water for establishment.
		- pruning: can be done annually to maintain the desired shape and promote healthy growth.
		- harvesting of the fruit occurs in the dry season, typically several months after flowering.
	- **good neighbors**: inga edulis grows well with other nitrogen-fixing trees, fruit trees, and shade-tolerant crops. it is often used in agroforestry systems with cacao, coffee, and various fruit trees like banana and citrus.
	- **bad neighbors**: it should not be planted with crops that require full sunlight for optimal growth, as its dense canopy can create too much shade.
