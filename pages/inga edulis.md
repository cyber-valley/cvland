- [[plant/type]]: [[fast-growing]] [[nitrogen-fixing]] tropical tree
- properties
	- root: deep taproot with extensive lateral roots and [[nitrogen-fixing]] nodules
	- stem: upright, branching, semi-softwood when young, becoming sturdy with age
	- leaf: alternate, pinnately compound with 4–6 pairs of leaflets, elliptical with pointed tips
		- leaf-length:: 20–35 cm (compound leaf)
	- flower: cream-white, fuzzy, brush-like, [[fragrant]], clustered in axillary inflorescences
	- fruit: long, cylindrical pods (30–100 cm) with pulpy edible white aril surrounding [[seeds]]
	- bark: thin, light gray-brown, slightly fissured on mature trees
	- timber: light, low-density, used for [[firewood]] and local [[construction]]
	- environment:: thrives in humid tropical climates with rich soils, moderate shade tolerance, and year-round rainfall
		- climate:: humid lowland tropics, tolerates periodic drought and temporary flooding
			- sun:: 600–900 W/m²
			- no-sun-days:: 10–15 days
			- water:: 1500–3500 mm/year
			- no-water-days:: 20–30 days
			- humidity:: 70–95 %
			- fog-resistance:: 10–15 days
			- max-temp:: 40 °C
			- optimal-temp:: 22–30 °C
			- min-temp:: 5 °C
			- wind-damage:: cold-dry, strong-salty
		- soil:: well-drained fertile soils with good organic matter, tolerates moderate acidity and temporary flooding
			- soil-ph:: 5.0–6.8
			- soi-type::[[loamy]] , [[clay-loam]], [[alluvial]]
		- spacing:: 5–10 m depending on use (orchard vs. agroforestry [[canopy]])
			- good-neighbors:: [[cacao]], [[banana]], [[cassava]], [[piper]], [[ananas]]
			- bad-neighbors:: [[eucalyptus]], [[casuarina]]
			- max-height:: 15 m
			- max-spread:: 12 m
	- lifecycle
		- longevity:: 30–40 years
		- germination:: seeds germinate rapidly in 3–10 days, do not store well (recalcitrant)
		- seedling:: [[fast-growing]], reaches 1–2 meters in the first year under moist conditions
		- mature:: begins fruiting in 3–5 years, continues annually with high productivity under good care
		- death:: declines with water stress or [[fungal]] root issues, usually managed as part of successional systems

	- operations
		- [[propagate plants]]: grown from [[seed]] immediately after harvest, can also propagate by stake or cutting in humid, protected beds
		- [[maintenance]]: prune to manage height and shape, especially in [[agroforestry systems]], coppices well, add [[mulch]] and [[compost]] annually
		- [[harvest]]:
			- fruit: harvested when pods mature and become slightly soft, aril is eaten fresh or processed
			- seed: extracted from pulp, dried for [[flour]] or [[animal feed]]
			- leaves: used as [[mulch]] or [[fodder]], collected manually
			- wood: harvested from prunings or old trees for [[firewood]] and [[biochar]]
