	- fruits (pods): flattened, linear pods; initially green, turn brown when mature, numerous flat, brown glossy seeds.
		- compounds: [[mimosine]], [[tannins]], [[alkaloids]], fiber
	- bark: smooth, grayish-brown bark, becomes fissured with age.
		- compounds: [[tannins]], fiber, [[alkaloids]]
	- timber: moderately dense, durable, pale brown wood, resistant to pests.
		- compounds: cellulose, [[lignin]], hemicellulose, minor tannins

		- wind-damage:: [[wind/storm]], [[wind/hurricane]]
	- soil:: prefers deep, fertile, neutral to alkaline soils with good drainage.
		- soil-ph:: 6.0–8.5
		- soil-type:: [[soil/loam]], [[soil/sandy]], [[soil/clay-loam]]
	- spacing:: optimal planting density is 2–4 meters between individual plants.

		- max-height:: 2000 cm
		- max-spread:: 800 cm
	- lifecycle
		- longevity:: 25 years
		- germination:: seeds germinate rapidly, typically within 3–14 days, after scarification or soaking.
		- seedling:: quick initial growth; seedlings reach 1 meter within 3–4 months, vulnerable to browsing animals.
		- mature:: rapid maturity in 2–3 years; extensive foliage, prolific flowering, and seed production.
		- death:: gradual decline after 15–20 years, susceptible to pests or fungal diseases; often rejuvenated through coppicing.

- operations
- [[propagation]]: regular pruning or coppicing promotes vigorous regrowth; minimal fertilization required due to nitrogen-fixing capacity. Periodic pest monitoring recommended.
- [[maintenance]] regular pruning or coppicing promotes vigorous regrowth; minimal fertilization required due to nitrogen-fixing capacity. Periodic pest monitoring recommended.
- [[harvest]]: leaves and young twigs regularly harvested as fodder; timber harvested from coppiced stems every 2–3 years; pods collected for seed production and propagation.
