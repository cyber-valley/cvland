### how we store and manage food
- > this page describes how we store food in refrigerators and freezers, how we label and organize items, and how we manage stock through regular inventory checks.
- #### cold storage: use and maintenance
- #### temperature
	- fridges stay between 0–4°c
	- freezer stays at -18°c or lower
- #### what goes where
- left fridge: ready-to-eat food  
  > dairy, cooked meals, leftovers
- right fridge: raw produce  
  > vegetables, fruits, herbs
- freezer and lower fridge shelves: raw meat and poultry  
  > avoid cross-contamination
- #### labeling
- everything stored must be labeled:
	- item name
	- date of preparation or delivery
	- expiration date (if applicable)
- #### containers
	- use airtight containers or food-safe wrapping
	- if original packaging is damaged → re-pack it
- #### rotation
	- always use FIFO: first in, first out
	- older stock is used before newer
	- check expiration dates regularly and remove anything expired
- #### segregation
	- store allergen-containing items separately
	- keep raw and cooked foods apart
- #### hygiene
	- clean fridges and freezers regularly
	- wipe up spills and residues immediately

- ### inventory: how we keep track
- routine
	- quick inventory checks happen weekly
	- full inventory happens at the end of each month
- organizing
	- group items by category:
		- dry goods
		- perishables
		- frozen items
	- use FIFO in cooking and ordering → older stock is used first
- record keeping
	- all stock movement is logged
	- we maintain a shared sheet (physical or digital) with:
		- item name
		- quantity
		- expiration date (if relevant)
- inspection
- during inventory checks:
	- check for spoilage, contamination, or damage
	- remove expired or spoiled products immediately
- #### reordering
	- we track minimum stock levels for critical items
	- if anything is running low → send a message to the shared channel before it’s gone
- #### food delivery
	- deliveries are checked before storing
	- items are inspected for freshness and condition
	- anything damaged, leaking, or not meeting quality is not accepted
