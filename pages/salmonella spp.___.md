- salmonella spp. are gram-negative, rod-shaped bacteria belonging to the family [[enterobacteriaceae]]. salmonella species commonly cause foodborne illnesses and gastrointestinal infections, widely known as [[salmonellosis]]. these bacteria colonize the intestinal tract of humans and animals, frequently contaminating food and water.
- ## diseases caused by salmonella spp.:
	- [[gastroenteritis (salmonellosis)]]: characterized by diarrhea, abdominal cramps, fever, nausea, and vomiting.
	- [[typhoid fever]]: a severe, systemic illness with prolonged fever, headache, fatigue, and possible complications involving multiple organs.
	- [[paratyphoid fever]]: similar but typically less severe than typhoid fever.
	- [[bacteremia]] : salmonella can enter the bloodstream, leading to serious systemic infections and sepsis.
- ## habitats and transmission:
	- intestines of humans and animals: salmonella naturally resides in the gastrointestinal tracts of animals, especially poultry, cattle, pigs, and reptiles.
	- environmental reservoirs: contaminated water, soil, and improperly stored or cooked food.
	- transmission: primarily through ingestion of contaminated food (particularly eggs, poultry, dairy products), contaminated water, or via direct or indirect contact with infected animals or their feces.
- salmonella infections are managed by supportive care, particularly hydration and electrolyte balance. antibiotics may be used in severe infections or systemic illness. preventive measures include thorough cooking of food, safe food handling, personal hygiene, and proper sanitation practices.
