- ### review of the psidium guajava
- [[psidium guajava]], commonly known as [[guava]], is a small tropical tree or shrub native to central america and widely cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions around the world. it is valued for its [[sweet]], [[nutritious]] fruit, medicinal properties, and versatility in [[agroforestry systems]].
- [[psidium guajava]] is a [[resilient]], [[fast-growing]] tree that provides [[abundant]] food, [[medicine]], and biomass. it plays multiple roles in sustainable farming and agroecological systems and is a great choice for home gardens, food forests, and [[permaculture]] designs.
- **parts of the plant and their uses:**
	- **root**: roots are not commonly used but may be included in some [[traditional medicine]] preparations for treating [[digestive]] and [[inflammatory]] conditions.
	- **stem**: woody stems are occasionally used for small tools or [[fuelwood]]. also useful as structural support in [[agroforestry]] or living fences.
	- **fruit**: the main economic product. [[fruits]] are rich in [[vitamin c]], [[fiber]], and [[antioxidants]]. eaten fresh, juiced, or processed into [[jams]], [[jellies]], [[candies]], and [[beverages]].
	- **leave**: used extensively in [[traditional medicine]] for treating [[diarrhea]], [[wounds]], [[cough]], and [[inflammation]]. often used as [[herbal tea]] or [[poultice]].
	- **bark**: used in [[decoctions]] and [[tinctures]] for its [[astringent]] and [[antimicrobial]] properties, especially in [[digestive]] treatments.
	- **flower**: small white flowers are not widely used, but may be infused for mild [[calming]] [[teas]] or used in traditional remedies.
- **uses of psidium guajava:**
	- **plants/fruits**: highly nutritious [[fruit]] consumed fresh or processed.
	- **plants/greens**: leaves are used in [[teas]] and [[poultices]] but not consumed as vegetables.
	- **plants/flowers**: flowers may be used in [[infusions]] and traditional remedies for [[calming]] effects.
	- **plants/resins**: does not produce commercial resin.
	- **plants/timber**: wood is dense and [[termite-resistant]], used locally for posts, tools, and [[firewood]].
	- **plants/medicine**: leaves, bark, and fruit are used in [[traditional medicine]] for [[digestive issues]], [[diabetes]], [[inflammation]], [[skin]] problems, and [[infections]].
	- **plants/fuel**: [[wood]] is a good source of [[firewood]] and [[charcoal]] in rural areas.
	- **plants/textile**: not used for fiber or textiles.
	- **plants/fertilizer**: pruned leaves and twigs decompose quickly and add organic matter to soil. fallen fruit can be used as [[compost]].
- **data:**
	- **sun requirements**: [[full sun]] preferred for fruit production, tolerates light [[shade]].
	- **water requirements**: moderate water needs. [[drought-tolerant]] once established, but regular watering improves fruit [[yield]].
	- **soil ph**: grows best in slightly acidic to neutral soils (ph 5.5 to 7.0).
	- **plant/roles in permaculture guilds**: guava is excellent in tropical and subtropical [[permaculture]] systems. it provides [[fruit]], [[biomass]], and [[windbreaks]]. its dense [[canopy]] offers partial [[shade]] for [[herbs]] or young trees. its roots improve [[soil structure]], and it benefits from companion planting with [[nitrogen-fixers]] like [[pigeon pea]], [[ground covers]] like [[sweet potato]], and [[dynamic accumulators]] like [[comfrey]].
	- **height in meters**: typically 3–8 meters tall, can reach up to 10 meters.
	- **spacing in meters**: 3–6 meters between trees, depending on variety and management.
	- **germination days**: seeds germinate in 14–30 days. propagation is also done by cuttings or grafting for better fruit quality.
	- **strata**: low to [[mid canopy]] tree in [[agroforestry]]. fits well in the [[sub-canopy]] layer.
	- **days to maturity**: [[seedlings]] bear fruit in 2–4 years. grafted trees may fruit in 1–2 years.
	- **plant, harvest, pruning calendar in months**:
		- **planting**: best at the beginning of [[rainy season]] (march–may).
		- **pruning**: prune lightly after harvest to control shape and encourage branching.
		- **harvest**: fruit ripens 4–6 months after flowering; main harvest varies by climate but often occurs in dry season (august–november).
	- **good neighbors**: grows well with [[bananas]], [[cassava]], [[pigeon pea]], [[lemongrass]], [[comfrey]], and [[sweet potato]]. benefits from [[nitrogen-fixers]] and [[mulch]]-producing plants.
	- **bad neighbors**: avoid planting too close to large [[canopy tree]] that block sunlight, or crops that are very sensitive to root competition.
