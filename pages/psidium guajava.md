	- operations
		- [[propagate plants]]: most commonly grown from seed; improved cultivars propagated by grafting, air-layering, or cuttings
		- [[maintenance]]: prune annually after fruiting to control height, shape, and encourage flowering; mulch and compost around root zone
		- [[harvest]]:
			- fruit: hand-harvested when yellow or light green and aromatic, fruiting occurs 2–3 times per year in tropical zones
			- leaves: collected for [[tea]] or [[extract]], young, mature green leaves preferred
			- bark: harvested from mature trees for decoction in [[traditional medicine]]
			- timber: used from old or pruned trees, applied in basic [[carpentry]] and [[firewood]]
