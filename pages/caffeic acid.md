- caffeic acid is a naturally occurring [[phenolic acid]] belonging to the group of hydroxycinnamic acids, widely present in plants such as coffee, fruits, vegetables, grains, and herbs. it exhibits strong [[antioxidant]], [[anti-inflammatory]], and [[antimicrobial]] activities, playing a significant role in plant defense and human health.
- ## chemical properties
	- chemical formula: C₉H₈O₄
	- molecular weight: 180.16 g/mol
	- solubility: moderately soluble in water, highly soluble in organic solvents (ethanol, acetone)
	- melting point: 223–225°C
	- structure: aromatic benzene ring with hydroxyl groups (phenolic), unsaturated carboxylic side-chain
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- powerful antioxidant, neutralizing [[free radicals]], reducing oxidative stress, and inflammation
	- supports [[cardiovascular health]] by improving endothelial function and [[reducing blood pressure]]
	- [[neuroprotective]] potential against diseases such as [[alzheimer’s disease]], [[parkinson’s disease]], and other neurodegenerative conditions
	- topical applications in dermatology to protect skin from [[UV damage]] and reduce signs of aging
