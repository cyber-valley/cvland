- [[prothrombin]], also known as [[coagulation factor ii]], is a vital [[plasma protein]] produced by the [[liver]] that plays a central role in the [[blood clotting cascade]]. it is the inactive precursor of [[thrombin]], an enzyme that converts [[fibrinogen]] into [[fibrin]], forming the structural basis of a blood clot. [[vitamin k]] is essential for the synthesis of prothrombin.
	- ### chemical properties
		- **molecular weight**: ~72 kDa
		- **structure**: glycoprotein composed of several domains, including a [[gla domain]] that requires vitamin k for function
		- **synthesis site**: liver
		- **activation**: activated to thrombin by factor xa in the presence of calcium ions, phospholipids, and factor v
	- ### usefulness in medicine
		- prothrombin levels are measured in prothrombin time (pt) tests to assess [[coagulation disorders]] and monitor [[warfarin therapy]].
		- deficiencies or mutations in prothrombin (e.g., [[prothrombin gene mutation 20210a]]) can lead to [[bleeding disorders]] or [[increased risk of thrombosis]].
		- prothrombin complex concentrates are used to treat bleeding in patients with [[hemophilia]] or on [[anticoagulants]].
		- maintaining adequate prothrombin levels is critical during surgery or trauma to ensure proper clot formation and reduce [[hemorrhage risk]].
	- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
		- while prothrombin itself does not exhibit direct antimicrobial properties, it plays an indirect role in the immune response by supporting [[wound closure]] and reducing [[infection risk]].
		- by enabling clot formation, it helps isolate invading pathogens and facilitates [[tissue healing]].
