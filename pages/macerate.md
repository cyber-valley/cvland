	  **notes:**
	- **safety precautions:** when making oil macerates, ensure all plant materials are thoroughly dried to prevent mold and bacterial growth. for plants like garlic and chili peppers, there is a risk of botulism when infusing fresh ingredients in oil. to mitigate this, keep the infusion refrigerated and use it within one week, or consider using dried forms of the plants.
	- **carrier oils:** common carrier oils include [[olive oil]], [[sunflower oil]], or [[sweet almond oil]].
	- **infusion time:** store the jar in a cool, dark place and shake it occasionally. after the infusion period, strain out the plant material and store the oil in a clean container.

	- **drying temperatures:**
		- low temperatures (**35–45°c**) are ideal for delicate herbs, flowers, and leaves to preserve their essential oils and active compounds.
		- higher temperatures (**50–60°c**) are suitable for sturdier materials like roots, bark, seeds, and woody parts.
	- **drying times:**
		- times can vary based on the drying method (air drying, dehydrator, oven) and environmental conditions such as humidity and airflow.
		- **check periodically:** always monitor the drying process to prevent over-drying or degradation of the plant material.
	- **dryness indicators:**
		- **leaves and herbs:** should crumble easily between your fingers.
		- **flowers:** should be dry but retain their color and shape.
		- **roots and bark:** should be hard and snap easily without bending.
	- **storage:**
		- after drying, store plant materials in airtight containers.
		- keep them in a cool, dark place away from moisture to maintain their properties.
	- **safety precautions:**
		- **preventing mold and spoilage:**
			- ensure all plant materials are thoroughly dried to reduce moisture content to around **10–12%**, which inhibits mold growth.
		- **avoid direct sunlight:**
			- when air drying, keep materials out of direct sunlight to preserve color and active constituents.
		- **using food dehydrators:**
			- provides consistent results and reduces drying times compared to air drying.
	- **additional tips:**
		- **labeling:**
			- label your dried materials with the name and date of drying to keep track of freshness.
		- **quality check:**
			- discard any plant material that shows signs of mold, discoloration, or off-smells.
	- **disclaimer:**
		- drying temperatures and times can vary based on specific equipment and local environmental conditions. it's advisable to consult specialized resources or professionals for precise guidelines tailored to your situation.
