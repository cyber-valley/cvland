- macro pattern governing biome dynamics
- it is the invisible hand define by
	- [[temperature]]: average, range, seasonal
	- [[precipitation]]: amount, rhythm
	- [[humidity]]: water in air
	- [[sun]]: exposure, angle, duration
	- [[wind]]: direction, intensity, flow pattern
- the key to climate, is microclimate
	- sunlight exposure: south-facing vs north-facing slopes
	- wind protection: behind a hedge vs in open field
	- moisture: near a pond vs on a rocky slope
	- thermal mass: near stone wall vs open air
	- canopy cover: shade vs full sun
