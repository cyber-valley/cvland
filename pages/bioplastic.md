- vision
	- build durable, living structures using fully local, regenerative, biodegradable materials
	- create a closed-loop, fully soil-safe architecture system able to rival industrial materials like polycarbonate
	- but rooted in tropical agroforestry ecosystems
- core material system
	- cassava starch bioplastic (body)
	- banana fiber reinforcement (strength)
	- damar resin coating (waterproof and uv shield)
	- volcanic clay slip (surface hardness and microbial resistance)
	- optional beeswax overlay (flexibility in harsh conditions)
	- alang-alang thatch (roofing top protection)
- material properties
	- | feature             | result                    |
	  |---------------------|----------------------------|
	  | waterproofness      | high (damar resin coating) |
	  | uv resistance       | moderate-high (clay and shading) |
	  | mechanical strength | medium-high (fiber core)   |
	  | lifespan            | 8–12 years (upgradable to 15+ with maintenance) |
	  | biodegradability    | full (soil-safe recycling) |
	  | transparency        | semi-translucent (milky diffuse light) |
	  | repairability       | easy (re-coating damar and slip patching) |
- material production system
	- [[manihot esculenta]] — starch source
	- [[musa]] — fiber source
	- [[shorea]], [[agathis]] — resin source
	- [[cocos nucifera]] — glycerin, oils
	- [[trigona]] — beeswax
	- [[volcanic clay]] from [[andosol]]  — for surface treatments
	- rainwater — for processing
- architecture layering concept
  
  ```
  (alang-alang thatch top shield)
  ---
  (bamboo batten framework)
  ---
  (air gap for ventilation)
  ---
  (bioplastic sheet — cassava starch + banana fiber core)
  (damar resin hard coating + clay slip)
  ---
  (bamboo or light timber framing)

  (stilted raised stone or bamboo foundation)
  ```
- maintenance protocol
- | time      | action |
  |-----------|--------|
  | every 6 months | visual inspection, minor repairs |
  | every 5 years  | re-apply damar resin layer if needed |
  | every 10 years | partial or full alang-alang rethatching |
  | every 15–20 years | refresh bioplastic panels if necessary |
- ### performance summary
	- structures expected lifespan: **40–50+ years** (core frame)
	- bioplastic roofing elements lifespan: **8–12 years** per cycle
	- all components compostable or recyclable onsite
- ### regenerative architecture model
	- 1. grow materials within agroforest modules.
	- 2. harvest and process materials with low energy techniques.
	- 3. build modular, repairable, breathable structures.
	  4. maintain through light interventions.
	- 5. recycle materials back into soil after full use cycle.
- outcome
	- zero toxic waste
	- zero dependence on industrial supply chains
	- self-renewing building material economy
	- full integration with local ecosystem cycles
- strategic advantages
	- | advantage            | reason |
	  |----------------------|--------|
	  | full material sovereignty | independence from global supply lines |
	  | resilience to climate | breathable, flexible architecture that adjusts naturally |
	  | community empowerment | local labor and knowledge centered construction |
	  | ecological restoration | buildings that support forest health, not destroy it |
- final philosophy
	- build as forests build:
	- growing structures from living networks,
	- replacing decay with rebirth,
	- merging architecture with ecology
