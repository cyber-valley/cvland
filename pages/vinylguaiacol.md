- vinylguaiacol is a naturally occurring [[phenolic]] compound derived from [[ferulic acid]] and found in plants, fermented foods, and as a volatile product in thermal processing. it has a distinct clove-like aroma and plays a significant role in the flavor profile of certain beers, wines, breads, and smoked foods. it is also a metabolic product of some yeast and bacterial strains.
	- ### chemical and physical properties
		- **compound type**: phenolic vinyl ether
		- **molecular weight**: 150.17 g/mol
		- **chemical formula**: C₉H₁₀O₂
		- **boiling point**: ~240–250°C
		- **solubility**: slightly soluble in water; soluble in ethanol and organic solvents
		- **appearance**: colorless to pale yellow liquid with strong spicy odor
	- ### usefulness in food and biotechnology
		- contributes to the **spicy/clove-like aroma** in **wheat beers** (e.g., hefeweizen) due to yeast metabolism of [[ferulic acid]].
		- found in **roasted coffee**, **smoked foods**, and **cooked vegetables** as a product of thermal degradation of lignin or ferulates.
		- can be used as a **flavoring agent** or **fragrance** in food and cosmetic products.
		- produced biotechnologically using microbial fermentation, particularly by [[bacillus]], [[saccharomyces]], or [[lactobacillus]] strains.
	- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
		- exhibits moderate **antibacterial** properties due to its **phenolic structure**, which can disrupt microbial membranes.
		- effective against foodborne pathogens and spoilage organisms in some studies.
		- potential use in **natural preservatives** or as a **bioactive food compound**.
