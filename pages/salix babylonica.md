		- **flowers**: dioecious catkins, inconspicuous, yellowish-green
			- **compounds**: [[flavonoids]], pollen constituents
		- **fruits**: capsules with small, cottony seeds dispersed by wind
			- **compounds**: cellulose fibers, minimal secondary metabolites
		- **timber**: soft, lightweight wood, pale yellowish-white
			- **compounds**: [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]], [[lignin]]
- **environment**: optimal growth near freshwater bodies (streams, rivers, lakes) with abundant moisture
	- **climate**: temperate with moderate rainfall and mild temperatures
		- **sun**: 500–800 W/m²
		- **no-sun-days**: 30 days
		- **water**: 700–1500 mm annually

		- **humidity**: 60–80%
		- **fog-resistance**: 45 days
		- **max-temp**: 35°C
		- **optimal-temp**: 15–25°C
		- **min-temp**: -15°C
		- **wind-damage**: strong winds, gale, hurricane
	- **soil**: moist, deep, fertile, well-drained loamy soils
		- **soil-ph**: 5.5–7.5
		- **soil-type**: loam, clay loam, sandy loam
	- **spacing**: ideally 10–15 m apart due to extensive roots and canopy spread

		- **max-height**: 1500 cm
		- **max-spread**: 1200 cm
- **lifecycle**
	- **longevity**: up to 70 years
	- **germination**: seeds require moist conditions; immediate germination after dispersal
	- **seedling**: rapid growth in moist, nutrient-rich soils; drought-sensitive
	- **mature**: distinctive weeping form established; resilience increases; extensive root network developed
	- **death**: gradual dieback often due to disease, drought, or physical damage
- **[[plant/features]]**: weeping branches, ornamental foliage, erosion control, shade provision, fast growth
- **[[biome/layer]]**: riparian, temperate forest, wetland margins
- **[[products]]**: ornamental woodcraft, erosion control products, biomass fuel, medicinal extracts
- **[[chemical compounds]]**:
	- | plant part | chemical compounds |
	  | root | salicin, tannins, phenolic glycosides |
	  | bark | salicin, flavonoids, tannins, phenolic acids |
	  | leaves | flavonoids, phenolic glycosides, tannins |
	  | flowers | flavonoids, pollen constituents |
	  | fruits | cellulose fibers, minimal secondary metabolites |
	  | timber | cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin |
- **operations**:
	- **[[propagation]]**: primarily vegetative via cuttings; seeds rarely used due to rapid viability loss
	- **[[maintenance]]**: regular pruning to maintain shape, remove diseased limbs, and monitor root spread
	- **[[harvest]]**:
		- ornamental wood selectively harvested from mature trees
		- biomass from branches collected after pruning
		- medicinal extracts from bark sustainably harvested
