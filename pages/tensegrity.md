- systems that are structural frameworks where tension and compression elements work together
- often in ways that look counterintuitive, extremely light, or even floating
- the term comes from tensional integrity
	- describes a principle where rigid elements are held not by direct contact
	- but by network of tensioned components that suspend and stabilize them
- permaculture & off-grid
	- lightweight and low material use
	- less mass = less labor, fewer resources
	- resilient to earthquakes and wind
	- absorbs vibration without snapping
	- adaptable to local materials
	- easy to scale: modules can be combined or nested
- real-world inspirations
	- buckminster fuller’s domes
	- kenneth snelson’s floating sculptures
	- spider webs and plant root systems
	- nasa’s deployable space structures
