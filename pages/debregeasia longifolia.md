- ### the bio-properties of [[debregeasia longifolia]] berries
- nutrient and chemical composition
	- heavy metals and micronutrients
		- the berries contain various minerals, with [[calcium]] being the most abundant in both leaves and fruits.
		- the presence of heavy metals such as tead and [[chromium]] in the stems, leaves, and fruits indicates potential environmental contamination.
	- phyto-chemical metabolism
		- the berries are rich in tannins, with a concentration of 77.835 mg/100g, which is higher than that found in other berries like blueberries and raspberries.
		- other compounds include antioxidants, flavonoids, phenols, anthocyanins, vitamin c, and vitamin a.
