	- ### usefulness in medicine
		- beta-carotene is a major source of [[vitamin a]], which supports healthy [[vision]], [[immune function]], and [[skin health]].
		- its [[antioxidant]] properties help neutralize free radicals, reducing the risk of [[chronic diseases]] such as [[cancer]] and [[cardiovascular disorders]].
		- it promotes [[skin health]] by reducing oxidative damage, enhancing hydration, and preventing premature aging.
		- beta-carotene is used to support [[lung health]] and reduce the severity of respiratory diseases.
		- it may help protect against [[uv-induced skin damage]] by acting as an internal sunscreen.
	- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
		- while beta-carotene itself does not exhibit direct antimicrobial properties, its role in boosting immune function indirectly supports the body’s defense against infections.
