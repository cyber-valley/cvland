- general description
	- appearance
		- a medium-sized bird with a slender body and long tail.
		- it has gray upperparts and pale underparts with fine dark barring.
		- the throat and upper chest are unbarred and slightly paler than the rest of the underparts.
		- the wings are rounded, and the tail is long and slightly graduated.
		- the eyes are yellow, and the beak is dark and slightly curved.
	- size
		- measures about 28-32 cm in length.
		- typically weighs around 80-120 grams.
	- behavior
		- known for its distinctive and repetitive "coo-coo" call, often heard during the breeding season.
		- solitary and secretive, often perching quietly in dense foliage.
		- practices brood parasitism, laying its eggs in the nests of other bird species.
- habitat
	- range
		- found across the Himalayas and parts of east esia, including northern india, nepal, bhutan, china, taiwan, korea, and japan.
	- environment
		- inhabits a variety of forested environments, including montane and temperate forests, as well as mixed and deciduous woodlands.
		- prefers areas with dense tree cover for foraging and nesting.
- diet
	- primarily insectivorous, feeding on caterpillars, beetles, and other insects.
	- also consumes small vertebrates and occasionally fruits and berries.
- breeding
	- nesting
		- does not build its own nest; instead, it lays its eggs in the nests of other bird species, particularly warblers and other small songbirds.
		- the host species incubates the eggs and raises the cuckoo chick, often to the detriment of its own offspring.
	- reproduction
		- breeding season varies across its range but generally occurs during the warmer months.
		- female lays a single egg in the host's nest.
		- the cuckoo chick hatches earlier and grows faster than the host chicks, often outcompeting them for food.
- conservation status
	- currently not considered endangered or vulnerable.
	- listed as least concern by the iucn due to its wide range and stable population.
- interesting facts
	- the himalayan cuckoo's brood parasitism strategy allows it to reproduce without the need to build a nest or care for its young, which can increase its reproductive success.
	- its distinctive "coo-coo" call is often one of the first signs of its presence in an area.
	- the cuckoo's diet includes many hairy caterpillars that are avoided by other birds, helping to control pest populations.
