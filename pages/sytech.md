- welcome to the autonomy and sustainability knowledge graph
- created by [[rockets]]
- for [[cyber valley]] and [[citadel genesis]]
- disclaimer: the sytech knowledge graph is under construction
-
- what is sytech?
	- sytech is rooted to [[philosophy of harmonious complexity]]
	- on top of which we develop this design framework for fusing societies, biomes, technology, and architecture
	- this knowledge graph is semantic setting for [[autonomy]], prosperity and evolution
-
- sytech applied to [[network states]] and [[startup societies]] is practical design framework

	- [[sustainable energy system]]: how to build and make it work reliably?
	- [[water system]]: simple solutions for clean water
	- [[soil, heat and recycling]]: the source of magic
	- [[biome engineering]]: create efficient and high margin [[magic forest]]
	- [[longevity and health]]: simple secrets for better life
	- [[cryptography and web3]]: confident use of modern apps
	- [[learning and ai]]: knowledge graphs and prompt engineering basics
	- [[lowtech construction]]: building fast and cheap
	- [[sensors, dev and control]]: how to automate and lead community
