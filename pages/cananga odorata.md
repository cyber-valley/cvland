- ### review of the cananga odorata
- [[cananga odorata]] commonly known as [[ylang-ylang]], is a fast-growing tropical tree native to southeast asia and the pacific islands. it is widely cultivated for its strongly [[fragrant]] flowers, which are used in [[perfumery]], [[aromatherapy]], and [[traditional medicine]]. the plant thrives in warm, humid climates and plays multiple roles in [[agroforestry systems]] and home [[garden systems]].
- **cananga odorata** is a beautiful and valuable tree for tropical climates, especially where [[fragrant]] flower production is desired. it supports [[pollinators]], provides [[shade]], and can be integrated into home [[gardens]], [[food forests]], or as a [[border]] plant in [[permaculture]] systems.
- **parts of the plant and their uses**
	- **root**: roots are rarely used but may be included in [[traditional medicine]] as a mild [[sedative]] or [[tonic]] in some cultures.
	- **stem**: the stem or trunk provides soft [[wood]], not typically used for timber but may be used for [[fuel]] or small local [[construction]].
	- **fruit**: small, dark green to black drupes, not commonly used for human consumption, but sometimes eaten by [[birds]] and small [[mammals]].
	- **leave**: leaves may be used in folk medicine for [[treating fever]], [[wounds]], and [[digestive issues]], though not widely commercialized.
	- **bark**: used in traditional herbal preparations as an [[astringent]] and [[antiseptic]].
	- **flower**: the most valuable part of the plant. the fresh flowers are [[steam-distilled]] to extract [[essential oil]], which is used in [[perfumery]], [[cosmetics]], [[aromatherapy]], and sometimes medicine for [[stress]], [[anxiety]], and [[skin care]].
- **uses of cananga odorata**
	- **plants/fruits**: fruits are not widely used for food or products.
	- **plants/greens**: leaves can be used medicinally but not consumed as vegetables.
	- **plants/flowers**: flowers are used to extract [[essential oil]], and also used fresh in traditional ceremonies and for [[decoration]].
	- **plants/resins**: the plant does not produce commercial resins.
	- **plants/timber**: wood is soft and not durable for construction. sometimes used locally for [[firewood]] or small tools.
	- **plants/medicine**: [[essential oil]] and flower infusions are used in [[traditional medicine]] for [[calming]] the [[nervous system]], [[balancing hormones,]] relieving [[skin irritation]], and promoting [[relaxation]].
	- **plants/fuel**: wood and pruned branches can be used as [[firewood]].
	- **plants/textile**: not used in textile production.
	- **plants/fertilizer**: leaf litter can be composted to enrich the soil.
- **data**
	- **sun requirements**: prefers [[full sun]] but tolerates [[partial shade]]. optimal flowering in [[full sunlight]].
	- **water requirements**: moderate to high water needs, prefers consistently moist but [[well-drained]] soils. sensitive to drought.
	- **soil ph**: prefers slightly acidic to neutral soil (ph 5.5–7.0).
	- **plant/roles in permaculture guilds**: [[cananga odorata]] is useful in tropical [[permaculture]] as a fast-growing [[shade]] tree and [[pollinator]] attractor. its flowers [[provide habitat]] and [[nectar]] for [[bees]] and [[butterflies]]. the tree’s [[canopy]] creates a beneficial [[microclimate]] for [[understory]] plants. it grows well on the edge of food forests, alongside [[nitrogen fixers]] and [[flowering herbs]], and can be coppiced lightly for [[biomass]].
	- **height in meter**: typically grows 10–20 meters, but in cultivation often kept at 3–5 meters for easier flower harvest.
	- **spacing in meter**: trees should be spaced 5–7 meters apart for optimal airflow and access to sunlight.
	- **germination days**: seeds take 20–45 days to germinate, depending on soil warmth and moisture.
	- **strata**: mid to high [[canopy]] (depending on management), typically used as an [[emergent]] or overstory species in [[agroforestry]].
	- **days to maturity**: begins flowering within 2–3 years under ideal conditions, peak [[oil]] production around 4–5 years.
- **plant, harvest, pruning calendar in months**:
	- **planting**: best at the beginning of the rainy season (march–may).
	- **flower harvest**: year-round in warm climates, with peak flowering during dry periods.
	- **pruning**: prune every 6–8 months to control height and encourage flower production.
- **good neighbors**: grows well with [[bananas]], [[turmeric]], [[lemongrass]], [[citronella]], [[vetiver]], and [[nitrogen-fixers]] like [[gliricidia]] or [[pigeon pea]].
- **bad neighbors**: avoid planting with [[dense]], tall fast-growing trees that block sunlight. also avoid crops sensitive to root competition or needing dry soil.
