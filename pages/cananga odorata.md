- [[plant/type]]: [[fast-growing]] tropical [[evergreen tree]]
- properties
	- root: shallow to moderately deep fibrous system. adapted for tropical soils and [[erosion control]]
	- stem: upright trunk, flexible when young, grayish and lightly fissured with age
	- leaf: simple, alternate, ovate-lanceolate, dark green with smooth edges
		- leaf-length:: 8–20 cm
	- flower: drooping, star-shaped, long-petaled yellow-green to deep yellow flowers with intense [[fragrance]]
	- fruit: dark green to black, clustered ovoid drupes (~1.5 cm each)
	- bark: thin, slightly rough, light grey; aromatic when cut
	- timber: soft, light wood with aromatic quality; not used structurally
- environment:: lowland tropical environments with full sun, high humidity, fertile soils, and well-distributed rainfall
	- climate:: humid equatorial or monsoon tropical climate; grows best in protected warm areas
		- sun:: 800–1000 W/m²
		- no-sun-days:: 5–7 days
		- water:: 1500–2500 mm/year
		- no-water-days:: 10–20 days
		- humidity:: 70–90 %
		- fog-resistance:: 5–7 days
		- max-temp:: 38 °C
		- optimal-temp:: 24–32 °C
		- min-temp:: 12 °C
		- wind-damage:: strong-dry, cold-dry, salty-coastal
		- soil:: rich loamy soil with good drainage, high in organic matter, not compacted
			- soil-ph:: 5.5–6.8
			- soil-type:: [[loamy]], [[volcanic]], [[humus-rich]]
		- spacing:: trees should be spaced 5–7 m apart for full [[canopy]] development
			- good-neighbors:: [[curcuma]], [[zingiber]], [[ocimum]], [[etlingera]]
			- bad-neighbors:: [[eucalyptus]], [[ficus]]
			- max-height:: 20 m
			- max-spread:: 10 m
		- lifecycle
			- longevity:: 40–50 years
			- germination:: seeds germinate in 20–40 days. require warmth and consistent humidity. soft scarification improves rate
			- seedling:: moderate growth rate. protection from wind and heavy rain helpful in early months
			- mature:: starts flowering in 2–3 years. produces flowers nearly year-round in optimal conditions
			- death:: declines gradually; root stress, poor pruning, or pest infestation may accelerate death in later stages

		- operations
			- [[propagation]]: propagated by [[seed]] (fresh, viable for only a short time), [[softwood]] cuttings, or air-layering. [[seedling]] establishment best with warm humidity
			- [[maintenance]]: prune regularly after flowering to maintain size and airflow. [[mulch]] annually. requires [[well-drained]] soil and protection from strong [[wind]]
			- [[harvest]]:
				- fresh [[flowers]]: hand-picked early morning when [[fragrance]] is strongest
				- [[essential oil]]: steam-distilled from freshly opened flowers. yield ~0.2–0.3% by weight
				- [[flower water]]: [[hydrosol]] collected during distillation used in [[perfumery]] and [[skincare products]]
