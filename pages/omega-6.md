- omega-6 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids essential for human nutrition, characterized by the first double bond located at the sixth carbon from the methyl end. they are crucial for skin health, [[cellular membrane integrity]],[[inflammation regulation]] , and [[immune function]]. since the body cannot produce omega-6 fatty acids, dietary intake is necessary.
- ## chemical properties
	- main types:
		- [[linoleic acid]] essential, precursor to other omega-6 fatty acids
		- [[gamma-linolenic acid (gla)]] derived from la, anti-inflammatory
		- [[arachidonic acid (aa)]] derived from la, involved in inflammation and signaling pathways
	- solubility: insoluble in water; soluble in fats and organic solvents
	- structure: polyunsaturated hydrocarbon chains with cis double bonds
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- omega-6 fatty acids support healthy skin and hair, maintaining moisture barriers and reducing skin inflammation.
	- [[arachidonic acid (aa)]] plays a critical role in cellular signaling, immune responses, and the formation of pro-inflammatory mediators ([[prostaglandins]], [[leukotrienes]])
	- balanced consumption of omega-6 can reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases by improving cholesterol profiles and lipid metabolism.
- ## [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- omega-6 fatty acids, especially [[linoleic acid]], exhibit direct antimicrobial properties against specific bacteria and fungi by disrupting cell membranes and inhibiting microbial growth.
	- bacteria
		- [[staphylococcus aureus]]
		- [[streptococcus pyogenes]]
		- [[escherichia coli]]
		- [[helicobacter pylori]]
	- fungi
		- [[candida albicans]]
