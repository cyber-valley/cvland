	- its name, "plaintive," reflects the sorrowful quality of its repetitive call, which is a common sound in its habitat during the breeding season.
	- despite being a brood parasite, the plaintive cuckoo is a highly adaptable bird that can thrive in a variety of habitats, including human-modified landscapes.
