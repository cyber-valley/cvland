	- listed as least concern by the iucn due to its wide range and stable population.
- interesting facts
	- the plaintive cuckoo's brood parasitism strategy allows it to reproduce without the need to build a nest or care for its young, which can increase its reproductive success.
	- its name, "plaintive," reflects the sorrowful quality of its repetitive call, which is a common sound in its habitat during the breeding season.
	- despite being a brood parasite, the plaintive cuckoo is a highly adaptable bird that can thrive in a variety of habitats, including human-modified landscapes.
