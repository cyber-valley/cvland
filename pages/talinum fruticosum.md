	- ## operations:
		- **propagation**: propagated easily by seed or stem cuttings, stem cuttings root readily in moist soil or water within 7–10 days
		- **maintenance**: minimal maintenance; regular watering during dry periods, occasional fertilization with organic compost improves leaf yield
		- **harvest**: leaves harvested regularly once plants mature, ideally picking younger leaves for culinary uses and medicinal extracts, flowers harvested occasionally for ornamental purposes or extracts
