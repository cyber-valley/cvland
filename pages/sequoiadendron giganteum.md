- [[plant/iconic]], [[long-living]]
- [[products]]
	- [[wood]]: durable but brittle, used historically for [[construction]], [[fencing]], and [[shingles]]
	- [[resin]]: contains [[tannins]] with potential [[antimicrobial]] properties
	- [[ornamental]]: cultivated worldwide as a decorative tree in parks and estates
	- [[carbon sink]]: one of the most effective trees for [[carbon sequestration]]
- [[plant/features]]
	- [[largest living tree]]: by volume, not height
	- [[fire-resistant]]: thick bark and tannins provide high resistance to wildfires
	- [[longevity]]: can live for more than 3,000 years
	- [[fast initial growth]]: young trees grow quickly under the right conditions
- [[biome/layer]]:
	- [[canopy]],
	- [[emergent]]
- [[plant/type]]: [[tree]]
	- [[root]]:
		- shallow but wide-spreading root system, lacks a taproot
	- [[trunk]]:
		- massive, reddish-brown, deeply furrowed bark up to 90 cm thick
	- [[bark]]:
		- fibrous, fire-resistant, and rich in tannins
		- [[tannins]]:
			- provides natural fungal and insect resistance
	- [[leaves]]:
		- scale-like, evergreen, bluish-green in color
		- [[photosynthesis]]:
			- occurs even in winter due to year-round foliage
	- [[cone]]:
		- small (4-7 cm), oval, contains up to 200 seeds per cone
	- [[seeds]]:
		- winged, tiny (4-5 mm), wind-dispersed but often require fire to release
- [[environment]]:
	- native to [[California's Sierra Nevada mountains]]
	- [[climate]]: humid montane climate with wet winters and dry summers
		- sun:: 600
			- no-sun-days:: 50
		- water:: 1200
			- no-water-days:: 90
		- humidity:: 65%
		- fog-resistance:: moderate
		- max-temp:: 35°C
			- optimal-temp:: 20°C
				- min-temp:: -15°C
		- wind-damage:: resistant to moderate winds
	- [[soil]]:
		- prefers deep, well-drained sandy loam or granitic soil
		- soil-ph::
			- 6.0 - 7.5
		- soil-type::
			- sandy loam,
			- granite-derived,
			- moist but well-drained
	- [[spacing]]:
		- requires large space for full growth potential
		- good-neighbors::
			- [[Douglas fir]],
			- [[Ponderosa pine]]
		- bad-neighbors::
			- [[dense shrubbery]] that competes for water
		- max-height::
			- 95,000 cm
		- max-spread::
			- 8000 cm
- [[lifecycle]]
	- longevity::
		- 3 000 yers
	- germination:
		- requires stratification and exposure to light for optimal germination
	- seedling:
		- slow initial growth, vulnerable to drought and competition
	- mature:
		- starts producing cones at 12-20 years but reaches full size in centuries
	- death:
		- can die from [[root disease]], [[lightning strikes]], or fire suppression issues
- operations
	- propagation
		- [[seeds]]: best germination rates after exposure to fire or heat
		- [[cuttings]]: difficult to propagate vegetatively
	- maintenance
		- [[fire]]: occasional low-intensity burns promote seed dispersal
		- [[watering]]: young trees require supplemental watering in dry regions
	- harvest:
		- [[cones]]: can be collected and dried for seed extraction
		- [[wood]]: rarely harvested today due to conservation protections
