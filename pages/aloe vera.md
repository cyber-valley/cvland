- ### review of aloe vera
	- [[aloe vera]] is a [[succulent]] plant species widely known for its [[medicinal]] and [[cosmetics]] properties. it is native to the arabian [[peninsula]] but is cultivated in many tropical and arid regions around the world. aloe vera is easy to grow and [[highly valued]] in both [[traditional medicine]] and modern [[herbal]] industries.
	- [[aloe vera]] is a hardy, multipurpose plant ideal for small gardens, [[permaculture]] systems, and [[medicinal]] use. it is easy to maintain and provides valuable [[health benefits]] with minimal inputs.
- #### parts of the plant and their uses
	- **root**: the root system is shallow and fibrous, mainly used for anchoring and water absorption. it is not typically used in traditional medicine or industry.
	- **stem**: aloe vera does not have a prominent stem; its leaves arise directly from the base. the short stem may be used in [[propagation]] .
	- **fruit**: aloe vera produces small capsules containing [[seeds]] , but the fruit is not commonly harvested or used.
	- **leave**: the most valuable part of the plant. the fleshy leaves contain a [[clear gel]] and a [[yellow latex]] . the gel is used for [[skin care]] , [[burns]] , [[digestive aid]] , and [[cosmetics]] . the [[latex]] has laxative properties but can be [[toxic]] in large doses.
	- **bark**: aloe vera does not produce true bark due to its herbaceous nature.
	- **flower**: the plant produces [[tubular]] yellow or orange flowers on tall spikes. flowers are occasionally used in [[traditional medicine]] and to [[attract pollinators]] but are not widely used as a product.
- #### uses of aloe vera
	- **plants/greens**: the inner gel is sometimes added to drinks and smoothies.
	- **plants/flowers**: flowers are not widely harvested but may be used in teas or infusions for mild [[medicinal purposes]].
	- **plants/resins**: the [[latex]] from the [[leaves]] is considered a [[resinous substance]] with potent [[laxative effects]].
	- **plants/medicine**: aloe vera is widely used for [[treating skin]] conditions, [[burns]], [[wounds]], [[sunburn]], and [[inflammation]]. it also has internal uses for [[digestive health]] and [[immune]] support.
	- **plants/fertilizer**: leftover leaf material can be [[compost]]ed to enrich the soil, and diluted aloe gel is sometimes used as a [[foliar spray]] to support plant health.
	- **plants/timber**: not applicable due to soft, succulent structure.
- #### data
	- **sun requirements**: prefers [[full sun]] to [[partial shade]]. requires at least 6 hours of direct sunlight per day.
	- **water requirements**: [[drought-tolerant]], requires minimal watering. allow soil to dry out completely between waterings.
	- **soil ph**: thrives in slightly acidic to neutral soil, ph 6.0 to 7.0.
	- **plant/roles in permaculture guilds**: aloe vera serves as a [[groundcover]] and [[medicinal plants]] in [[permaculture]] systems. its dense, low-growing form [[reduce soil erosion]] and [[evaporation]]. the gel can be used in homemade [[foliar sprays]] and [[soil drenches]] to [[boost plant immunity]]. it [[attracts pollinators]] when flowering and can grow around the base of fruit trees as a living [[mulch]], especially in arid climates.
	- **height in meters**: typically 0.5 to 1 meter tall, including the flower stalk.
	- **spacing in meters**: space plants 0.4 to 0.6 meters apart for optimal air circulation and growth.
	- **germination days**: seeds germinate in 15–30 days under warm, moist conditions, though propagation is more commonly done via offshoots.
	- **strata**: groundcover to low herbaceous layer.
	- **days to maturity**: plants become harvestable 18–24 months after planting.
	- **plant, harvest, pruning calendar in months**:
		- **plant**: best during the [[dry season]] or early wet season (march–may).
		- **harvest**: year-round, once mature. outer leaves can be cut every 2–3 months.
		- **prune**: remove dead or damaged leaves throughout the year.
	- **good neighbors**: good companions include [[fruit trees]], [[agave]], [[lemongrass]], and [[rosemary]] . grows well near plants needing dry roots and sun.
	- **bad neighbors**: avoid planting near water-loving or fast-growing plants like [[mint]], as aloe vera may be outcompeted or suffer from root rot in too much moisture.
