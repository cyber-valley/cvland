	- this defines the plant as a fleshy, non-woody, [[evergreen]] species that persists for many seasons, storing water in its thick leaves.
	- properties
		- root: fibrous and shallow, adapted for rapid water uptake during brief rainfall events. roots spread close to the surface, allowing the plant to thrive in arid environments.
			- contains [[trace minerals]] and [[enzymes]] that support basic root metabolism and cellular function.
		- stem: reduced or almost absent; leaves emerge directly from a very short basal stem (crown). the stem is non-woody and mostly functions as a support base.
			- composed primarily of [[cellulose]] and small amounts of [[resin compounds that may provide [[antimicrobial]] protection.
		- leaf: thick, [[succulent]], and lanceolate with serrated margins; stores large amounts of [[gel]] within the inner tissue. the outer surface is waxy to prevent water loss.
			- the inner [[gel]] contains [[acemannan]], [[polysaccharides]], [[salicylic acid]], [[vitamins]] (a, c, e, b1, b2, b6, b12), [[lignin]], [[amino acids]], [[minerals]] ([[zinc]], [[calcium]], [[magnesium]]), and [[enzymes]] ([[amylase]], [[catalase]], [[lipase]]).
			- the latex layer beneath the skin contains [[aloin]], [[aloe-emodin]], and [[barbaloin]], which are biologically active and known for strong [[laxative effects]].
		- flower: grows on a tall raceme; tubular, yellow or orange, and pollinated by [[insects]] and [[birds]]. blooms once the plant matures.
			- contains [[flavonoids]], [[nectar]] (rich in [[sugars]]), and trace amounts of volatile [[essential oils]].
		- fruit: a small dry capsule that splits open when mature, releasing flat, black [[seeds]].
			- seeds contain small amounts of [[proteins]] and trace oils but are rarely used medicinally or nutritionally.
		- bark: absent; aloe vera is herbaceous and non-woody.
		- timber: not applicable; lacks woody tissue.
