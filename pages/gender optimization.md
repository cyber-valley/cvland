- in this article i describe the new type of policy for a more adoptable societies
- i am going to bet on it while building [[citadel genesis]]
- simple idea to solve [sociodemgraphic collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_decline) at low scale
- using [[gender price differentiation]] as result of [[community consensus]]
	- powerful males agree to pay significantly more when females and in exchange enjoy [[prosperity]]
	- smart females agree to share male and kids and in exchange also enjoy [[prosperity]]
	- everyone agree on economical domination of females over males in all key areas
- # disclaimer
	- being in blockchain community since the beginning i observed how males dominated the space
	- still up to 90% of participants in almost all engineering ralated events are males
	- this led to an extremely uneven capital distribution between genders
	- i think that was one of the biggest mistakes while building the industry
	- during citadel construction i believe even achieving normal balance 50/50 is already awesome
	- but if the society we build choose to growth really fast we have to look deeper into the culture more rationally
- the effect suggested by research that female-biased societies, if well-managed
	- could potentially lead to more rapid growth
	- better social outcomes
	- and increased resilience
	- offering a competitive edge in various domains
	- however, achieving and maintaining these benefits would require thoughtful programming
- key assumption is that population growth rate
	- is not only result of economic output
	- but also rely heavily on ratio between males and females
- there have been observations and studies
	- that suggest the gender balance in a population
	- can influence population growth
	- though the effects are complex and context-dependent
- key observations
	- female-biased sex ratios
		- in populations where there are more females than males, such as a 3:1 female-to-male ratio
		- population growth accelerate significantly
		- this is because each male can potentially father offspring with multiple females
		- leading to a higher birth rate and resource efficiency
	- male-biased sex ratios
		- when there are more males than females in a population
		- it can lead to increased competition among males for mates
		- resulting in heightened aggression and selective pressures
		- this often reduces birth rates since fewer females are available to reproduce
		- which can slow population growth and decrease genetic diversity
		- additionally, social structures may become disrupted
		- leading to behavioral changes and potential instability
		- over time, a persistent male-biased ratio can cause long-term demographic imbalances
		- including population decline and shifts in population structure due to migration or dispersal
		- the specific effects vary depending on species, mating systems, and environmental factors
	- 1:1 sex ratios
		- explained by [[fishers principle]]
		- on populations with a roughly equal number of males and females
		- population growth is more stable but may not be as rapid as in a female-biased ratio
		- the reproductive capacity is more evenly distributed among the males
		- leading to a balance between mating opportunities and offspring production
- benefits of 3:1 female:male target ratio
	- significantly accelerated population growth
		- simple model with demonstration starting from 1000 population

	- enhanced [[collective intelligence]] of community
		- research by wolley suggests
		- that groups with higher female representation
		- tend to perform better in collaborative problem-solving and decision-making
		- leading to more innovative and effective solutions to complex challenges
	- economic growth and innovation
		- as a result of a more dense resource usage needed to produce one offspring
		- larger, more diverse labor pool of female-biased society
	- environmental sustainability
		- women are often more involved in sustainable practices and environmental conservation
		- which can lead to better management of natural resources
		- and a stronger focus on ecological sustainability
	- social cohesion and stability
		- women often play key roles in community-building and social networking
		- which can enhance social cohesion and stability
		- stronger social support systems and more resilient communities
	- focus on family and education
		- societies with more women may place a greater emphasis on
		- family welfare, education, and child development
		- leading to better outcomes in these areas
	- balanced resource management
		- studies suggest that women often manage resources in ways
		- that prioritize long-term sustainability
		- which can contribute to more stable economic growth
	- better health and well-being
		- female-biased societies may prioritize healthcare
		- particularly maternal and child health
		- leading to overall improvements in public health and life expectancy
	- lower crime rates
		- some studies indicate that societies with more women
		- tend to have lower crime rates, particularly violent crimes
		- contributing to a safer and more stable environment
	- promotion of peace
		- may be more inclined towards peaceful conflict resolution and diplomacy
		- potentially reducing the likelihood of war and social unrest
	- focus on humanism
		- with more women in leadership roles
		- there might be a stronger focus on human rights, social justice, and equality
		- leading to a more inclusive and ethical society
	- balanced and diverse leadership
		- female-biased societies may have more women in leadership positions
		- leading to more balanced governance
		- that reflects diverse perspectives and priorities
	- effective governance and policy implementation
		- women in leadership roles have been shown to be effective in implementing policies
		- that address social issues, such as healthcare, education, and family welfare
	- greater resilience to social and economic shocks
		- female-biased societies is likely to develop
		- more adaptive social structures
		- that are better able to cope with economic or environmental crises
		- ensuring long-term resilience and stability
	- cultural soft power
		- if female-biased societies become known for their stability, innovation, and prosperity
		- they may exert greater cultural and diplomatic influence on the global stage
		- they might project an image of superiority
		- setting trends, attracting talent, investment, and alliances
- raising issues and their mitigations
	- resources availability
		- the availability of basic resources such as
		- [[land]], [[energy]], [[shelter]] and [[eat]] plays a critical role
		- even with a favorable female-biased ratio, if resources are scarce,
		- population growth may harm the environment
		- these needs must be optimized on the lowest level of [[community consensus]]
		- TODO article on [[token engineering]]
	- expensive physical force
		- as males are rare and mostly resourceful there is an issue with physical force availability
		- however with focus on robotics, animal education and nurturing soft force
		- the issue become advantage
	- social imbalance and gender inequality
		- issues of marriage, family formation, and gender roles
		- social tensions due to unmarried females
		- risks of exploitation where women are treated unfairly or coerced into relationships
		- TODO efficient [[mating system]] must be built
		- with policies optimizing assets under female control
	- genetic diversity and population health
		- a hacked gender ratio might reduce genetic diversity
		- particularly if fewer males are contributing to the gene pool
		- this could lead to increased vulnerability to diseases and other genetic issues
		- however if genetic set of males is engineered
		- the issue could also become advantage
		- as population can have scientifically and analytically
		- diverse enough set of genes which are also powerful
	- over dependence on social welfare systems
		- a larger female population might lead to overdependence on social welfare systems
		- especially if many women are single or supporting children without partners
		- we are going to handle this using
	- ethical and moral considerations
		- acceptance of polygamous form or relations as social norm
		- the intentional manipulation of gender ratios and related social policies
		- might raise ethical concerns, leading to resistance or backlash from certain segments of society
	- long-term sustainability
		- maintaining such a ratio over generations could prove challenging
		- especially if external factors (e.g., migration, cultural shifts, economic crises) disrupt the balance
		- so the ratio must be carefully maintained and decreased on saturation
	- social engineering risks
		- the level of social engineering required to maintain a stable 3:1 ratio
		- seems to involve significant interventions in personal and societal choices,
		- which could lead to resistance, ethical concerns, or unintended consequences
		- however our policy is voluntary, pure economical
		- and never intended to have any other policies for maintaining gender ratio
		- so it seems this is at least concern
	- global backlash
		- other societies might view the deliberate manipulation of gender ratios with suspicion or hostility
		- leading to diplomatic or economic conflicts
- conclusion
	- a society that can remain stable at a 3:1 female-to-male ratio
	- through careful cultural and economic programming
	- might have advantages
	- that could lead to a form of dominance over societies that do not follow this approach
	- however, this dominance would likely be contingent on the society's ability
	- to manage the inherent challenges, maintain long-term sustainability, and navigate the global response
	- to its unique social structure
	- the success of such a society would depend on its
		- adaptability
		- resilience, and the
		- effectiveness
	- of its policies in harnessing the full potential of its population
