- [[ointment]]
	- **ingredients:**
		- 1 cup [[plumeria rubra]] [[leaves]] or [[bark]]
		- 1/2 cup [[coconut oil]] or [[olive oil]]
		- 1 tablespoon [[beeswax]] (optional, for thicker consistency)
	- **instructions:**
		- **prepare the leaves/bark**: finely chop or crush the plumeria rubra leaves or bark.
		- **heat the oil**: in a double boiler or a heat-safe bowl over simmering water, heat the coconut or olive oil.
		- **infuse the oil**: add the chopped leaves or bark to the oil. simmer on low heat for about 2 hours, stirring occasionally. **49°C to 60°C**
		- **strain the mixture**: after 2 hours, strain the oil through a cheesecloth or fine strainer to remove the plant material.
		- **add beeswax** (optional): if you prefer a thicker ointment, melt the beeswax in the warm infused oil and stir until fully dissolved.
		- **cool and store**: pour the mixture into a clean, airtight container and let it cool completely before use.
	- **usage**: apply the ointment to the affected area 2-3 times daily for skin infections or inflammation.
- [[tea]]

		- 1 tablespoon dried plumeria rubra leaves or bark
		- 2 cups water
		- honey or lemon (optional, for taste)
	- **instructions:**
		- **boil the water**: bring 2 cups of water to a boil.
		- **add the dried leaves/bark**: once the water is boiling, add the dried plumeria rubra leaves or bark.
		- **simmer**: reduce the heat and let the mixture simmer for 10-15 minutes.
		- **strain the tea**: remove from heat and strain the tea to remove the plant material.
		- **add flavor** (optional): add honey or lemon to taste if desired.
	- **usage**: drink 1 cup of the tea once or twice daily for potential antimicrobial or anti-inflammatory benefits.
