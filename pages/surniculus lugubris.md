	  interesting facts
- the drongo cuckoo's mimicry of drongo calls is an example of aggressive mimicry, where it uses deception to gain an advantage in its environment.
- its brood parasitism strategy allows it to reproduce without the need to build a nest or care for its young, which can increase its reproductive success.
- despite being a brood parasite, the drongo cuckoo is highly adaptable and can thrive in a variety of forested habitats.
