- fusarium species are a group of filamentous fungi found in soil and organic matter. while they are primarily known for causing plant diseases, some species can cause infections in humans, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. these infections can be challenging to treat due to the fungi's resistance to many antifungal medications.
	- **diseases caused by fusarium spp:**
	- 1. **[[fusariosis]]:** a broad term for infections caused by fusarium species.
		- **[[cutaneous fusariosis]]:** infections of the skin, leading to red, [[painful nodules]], [[ulcers]], or [[cellulitis]]. this is more common in immunocompromised individuals, such as those undergoing chemotherapy.
		- [[onychomycosis]]: [[fungal infections]] of the [[nails]], causing discoloration, thickening, and separation from the nail bed.
	- 2. **[[keratitis]]:** infection of the cornea, often associated with contact lens use or eye trauma. symptoms include pain, redness, blurred vision, and discharge. fusarium keratitis can lead to severe damage to the cornea and potential vision loss if not treated promptly.
	- 3. **[[sinusitis]]:** fungal infection of the sinuses, which can occur in immunocompromised individuals or those with [[chronic sinus conditions]] symptoms include [[nasal congestion]], pain, and discharge.
	- 4. **[[disseminated fusariosis]]:** a severe and often fatal infection that occurs when fusarium spreads through the bloodstream to multiple organs. this primarily affects immunocompromised patients, such as those with leukemia or after a bone marrow transplant. symptoms can include fever, lung infections, and organ failure.
- **habitats and transmission:**
	- **environment:** widely distributed in soil, decaying vegetation, and plant debris. fusarium can also contaminate water and food products.
	- **transmission:** primarily occurs through direct contact with contaminated soil or plant material. infections can also occur through traumatic implantation (such as injuries or wounds) and inhalation of airborne spores. in healthcare settings, transmission can occur via contaminated medical equipment or solutions.
- preventing fusarium infections involves good hygiene practices, proper wound care, and avoiding contact with contaminated soil and plant material, especially for immunocompromised individuals. in healthcare settings, stringent infection control measures are essential to prevent nosocomial infections.
- treatment of fusarium infections can be challenging due to the fungi's resistance to many antifungal drugs. options may include:
	- **voriconazole:** often used for treating fusariosis, particularly in cases of keratitis and disseminated infections.
	- **amphotericin b:** another option for severe infections, though resistance can occur.
	- **posaconazole and itraconazole:** may also be used depending on the sensitivity of the fungal strain.
- early diagnosis and aggressive antifungal therapy are crucial for managing fusarium infections, especially in immunocompromised individuals, to improve outcomes and prevent severe complications.
