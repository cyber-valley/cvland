- phytosterols are naturally occurring, plant-derived sterols structurally similar to cholesterol. they are abundant in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, legumes, grains, fruits, and vegetables. phytosterols are primarily known for their cholesterol-lowering effects and their role as precursors to plant hormones such as [[brassinosteroids]]
- ## chemical properties
	- chemical structure: steroid nucleus with hydroxyl group, similar to cholesterol
	- solubility: insoluble in water; soluble in fats, oils, and organic solvents
	- main types include [[Î²-sitosterol]], [[campesterol]], and [[stigmasterol]]
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- effectively lower [[ldl cholesterol]] by inhibiting intestinal cholesterol absorption, reducing [[cardiovascular disease]] risk
	- possess [[anti-inflammatory]] properties, beneficial in conditions such as [[arthritis]] and [[autoimmune disorders]]
	- studied for [[anticancer]] properties, particularly in [[prostate]], [[breast]], and [[colon]] cancers
	- beneficial effects on [[prostate health]], notably through the reduction of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (bph) symptoms
- ## [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- phytosterols exhibit indirect antimicrobial activity by supporting immune function, reducing inflammation, and inhibiting microbial growth
	- bacteria:
		- [[staphylococcus aureus]]
		- [[escherichia coli]]
		- [[salmonella spp.]]
	- fungi:
		- [[candida albicans]]
