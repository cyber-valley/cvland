- [[plasmodium falciparum]] is a protozoan parasite belonging to the genus [[plasmodium]], responsible for causing the most severe form of [[malaria]] in humans. transmitted primarily through the bite of infected female [[anopheles mosquitoes]], p. falciparum infects red blood cells, causing widespread cellular destruction, inflammation, and systemic complications.
	- ## disease caused by plasmodium falciparum:
		- [[falciparum malaria]]: characterized by high fever, chills, headache, nausea, severe anemia, and potentially life-threatening complications such as cerebral malaria, respiratory distress, kidney failure, shock, and multi-organ failure.
	- ## habitats and transmission:
		- host organisms: humans (primary hosts) and female anopheles mosquitoes (vectors).
		- geographic distribution: prevalent mainly in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly africa, southeast asia, and south america.
		- transmission: occurs through mosquito bites; rarely transmitted via blood transfusions, contaminated needles, or from mother to child during pregnancy.
	- malaria treatment involves antimalarial medications (e.g., artemisinin-based combination therapies), supportive care, and preventive measures such as vector control, insecticide-treated bed nets, and chemoprophylaxis in high-risk areas.
