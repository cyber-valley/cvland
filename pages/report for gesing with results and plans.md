- last time we met more than year ago
- since than we advanced rapidly in our understanding of cyber valley project
- that was mostly research phase
- it helped us to identify a lot of opportunities and resources
- so i want to start from the first part: reporting our results to the community
	- energy: we are able to sustain our energy needs
		- 30 kw of solar panels
		- 30 kw of energy storage
		- 4 kw biogas reserve generator
		- working on wind generation
		- first test of a stove with pyrolysis for biochar production
	- water: supply 90% of water from rain
		- started water collection system
		- storing 60m3 closed and 60m of open water
		- research on quality and filtration is still ongoing
	- outstanding native biodiversity
		- 200 useful plant species in gardens
		- 100 plant species in the forest
		- 100 fungi species
		- 50+ species of birds according to independent researchers and universitas udayana
		- hundreeds of insect species
		- more than 20 wild animal species
	- on our sites we invest heavily in biodiversity
		- adding around 500 useful species to our gardens
		- likely one of the biggest collection of utility plants in semi wild conditions
		- giving shelter to 5 animal species
	- damaged soils
		- research of 10 ha of land
		- in collaboration with independent researchers and universitas udayana
		- nutrient rich andosol soils
		- mercury on fertilized plantations
		- needs 3 year remediation program for productive permanent garden
		- pretty good quality on not fertilized
	- construction
		- outstanding opportunities for sustainable wood production
		- more than 10 fast growing wood species for different applications
		- using our own wood for construction from fallen trees
	- network of trails
		- 5 km and growing on site
		- ~50 km of wild trails in batuka forest
	- roads
		- damaged road network
		- helped several times to recover major problems with roads
	- plastic
		- canyons, roads and fields are filled with plastic
		- researching ways for recycling
	- information
		- first version of sensor network
		- data published on https://sensors.social
			- micro particles 2.5 and 10
			- temperature and humidity
		- public knowledge graph on https://cv.land
		- collaboration is open source through https://github.com
	- community: around 100 workers and 300 visitors from all around the world
	- bioluminescence: fireflies, caterpillars and roots of some plants are glowing
- second part: plans
	- establish two companies
		- for development operations with our indonesian partners
		- for our family needs of small business
	- cyber valley opportunities research
		- geographic region around firefly canyon from gesing to seririt
		- project presented to some major bali entrepreneurs
	- bridge master planing
		- commercial district on 7.5 at [[cyber valley]] highlands
	- citadel genesis structuring
		- sustainable village on 30 ha on the slope of [[sang hyuang]]
		- rocket family estate as part of citadel genesis on 10 ha
	- ai square and organiq in gesing center
	- hostel for gesing guests not far from the waterfall
	- roadmap for more tourists in gesing
		- munduk handles at least 10 times more touristic flow
		- the key gesing attractors are
			- local culture with access to gesing waterfall
			- access to several volcanos and magic forest
			- innovative citadel construction and alta site
		- cleanup from plastic as unique value proposition
		- low noise environment is also a priority
		- big idea to become the cleanest eco desa on bali
		- we want to reach results this year
	- roadmap for more companies established in gesing
		- idea of experimental special economic zone for tech and it cluster
		- we can provide presentation of the idea discussed with leading bali entrouprenours
		- the biggest issue we heard is transfer of knowledge from foreigners to locals and back
		- we are running free english classroom for our workers for more than 1 year
		- soon we will find a way to teach bahasa to foreigners
		- we invest heavily into deep knowledge exchange between locals and foreigners
		- and hope on your support in this direction
- third part: our needs
	- help to spread our initiative to cleanup gesing from plastic
	- in some months we will be ready to buy plastic
		- at 1000 rupia per kg of random plastic
		- at 2000 rupia per kg of sorted plastic
		- plastic accepted only from gesing members
	- road access to eastern citadel genesis part: 2 meter width ready to build it
	- allow to reshape gesing waterfall: our funding and execution
	- but gesing waterfalls remains non commercial free to go public place
	- discussion of the idea of tech focused special economic zone in gesing
- fourth part: our thanks
	- we are very thank full for the trust our community provide
	- we switched our production calendar to the moon calendar
	- to align with Balinese rhythms
	- we love to live here
