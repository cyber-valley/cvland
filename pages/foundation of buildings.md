- Base technologies
	- Materials for "4x4x1" m with 0.2 m wall = 10 m3 concrete
		- Tube 160mm 1$ selfmade or 3-5$ buy
		  100-200 $ / m3 = 1000-2000$
		- Concrete ~40$ / m3 = 400$
		- Steel bar 420 class = 500-700$
		- Membrane Plastic HDPE 100x4x0.002 m 350$ = 50$
		- Integrated mount points, IP68 ???
		- TOTAL 2000-3000$
	- Concrete mixing & pouring

		- Heatpump - China -> Indoneisa 600 to 2000$ depend on functionality
		  Water|Water -> cold accumulator
		- Stove from brick -> heat, active carbon (400 'C),
		- Heat and cold accumulator
	- Air system (depend on Electric 50% min)
		- Solar heat collector (handmade) - polycarbonat?
