- aspergillus niger is a species of fungus commonly found in the environment, particularly in soil and decaying organic matter. it is known for its industrial applications but can also cause infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals.
	- **diseases caused by aspergillus niger:**
	- 1. **aspergillosis:** a range of infections caused by aspergillus species, including aspergillus niger.
		- [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]] **(abpa):** an [[allergic reaction in the lungs]], more commonly seen in individuals with [[asthma]] or [[cystic fibrosis]].
		- **[[aspergilloma]] (fungus ball):** a mass of fungal hyphae that can form in pre-existing lung cavities, leading to symptoms such as [[coughing]] and [[hemoptysis]] (coughing up blood).
		- **[[invasive aspergillosis]]:** a severe infection where the fungus invades and damages tissues, primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals, leading to severe lung infections and potentially spreading to other organs such as the brain and heart.
	- 2. **[[otomycosis]] (ear infection):** a fungal infection of the [[outer ear canal]], often resulting in itching, pain, and discharge. it is more common in warm and humid climates.
	- 3. **[[keratitis]]:** infection of the [[cornea]], often associated with contact lens use or eye trauma, leading to pain, redness, and vision problems.
	- **habitats and transmission:**
		- **environment:** found in soil, decaying vegetation, compost, and organic debris. it thrives in warm, humid conditions and can be present in indoor environments, including air, dust, and damp areas.
		- **transmission:** primarily occurs through inhalation of airborne spores. direct human-to-human transmission is rare.
- preventing aspergillus niger infections involves maintaining good hygiene, reducing exposure to environments with high spore counts (such as construction sites), and protecting immunocompromised individuals from exposure to contaminated air. in healthcare settings, measures to prevent infection include air filtration systems and minimizing exposure to potential sources of spores.
- treatment of aspergillus niger infections depends on the type and severity of the infection and may include antifungal medications such as voriconazole, itraconazole, or amphotericin b. for allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (abpa), corticosteroids may also be prescribed to reduce inflammation. early diagnosis and targeted therapy are essential to effectively manage infections and prevent complications.
