- ### usefulness in medicine
	- stearic acid is used in [[pharmaceutical formulations]] as a lubricant and stabilizer for tablets and capsules.
	- it supports [[skin health]] by acting as an [[emollient]], helping to soften and hydrate the skin.
	- stearic acid is included in [[cosmetic products]] for its thickening and stabilizing properties in [[creams]], [[lotions]], and [[soaps]].
	- it plays a role in [[energy metabolism]] as a source of energy for the body.
	- it is considered a relatively neutral saturated fat in terms of [[cardiovascular health]] compared to other saturated fatty acids.
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- stearic acid exhibits mild antimicrobial properties by disrupting the lipid membranes of certain microbes.
