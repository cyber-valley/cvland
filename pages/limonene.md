- ## usefulness in medicine:
	- ### [[antimicrobial]]
		- limonene has been shown to possess significant antimicrobial properties. it can inhibit the growth of various bacteria and fungi, making it a potential candidate for use in antimicrobial agents and disinfectants.
			- **bacteria**:
				- **[[staphylococcus aureus]]**: limonene has shown significant activity against this gram-positive bacterium, which is known for causing skin infections, respiratory diseases, and food poisoning.
				- **[[escherichia coli]]**: limonene has been effective against this gram-negative bacterium, which is a common cause of urinary tract infections and foodborne illnesses.
				- **[[salmonella typhimurium]]**: limonene exhibits antimicrobial activity against this gram-negative bacterium, responsible for salmonellosis, a type of food poisoning.
				- **[[bacillus cereus]]**: this gram-positive bacterium, associated with food poisoning, is susceptible to limonene's antimicrobial effects.
				- **[[listeria monocytogenes]]**: limonene has shown inhibitory effects against this gram-positive bacterium, which can cause listeriosis, particularly in pregnant women, newborns, and immunocompromised individuals.
				- **[[pseudomonas aeruginosa]]**: limonene demonstrates activity against this gram-negative bacterium, known for causing infections in burn wounds and respiratory infections in cystic fibrosis patients.
				- **[[methicillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus]] (mrsa)**: limonene has been found effective against mrsa, a strain of staphylococcus aureus that is resistant to many antibiotics, making it a serious public health concern.
			- **fungi**:
				- **[[candida albicans]]**: limonene has antifungal properties against this yeast, which can cause oral thrush, vaginal yeast infections, and systemic infections in immunocompromised individuals.
				- **[[aspergillus niger]]**: limonene shows activity against this fungus, which can cause respiratory infections, particularly in individuals with weakened immune systems.
				- **[[penicillium spp]].**: limonene is effective against species of this genus, which are known for causing food spoilage and can produce mycotoxins harmful to health.
				- **[[fusarium spp]].**: limonene demonstrates antifungal activity against fusarium species, which can cause infections in plants, animals, and humans.
				- **[[trichophyton spp]].**: limonene has been effective against dermatophytes of this genus, which are responsible for skin infections such as [[athlete's foot]] and [[ringworm]].
	- ### [[anti-inflammatory]]
		- limonene exhibits anti-inflammatory properties, which can be beneficial in reducing inflammation and associated pain. this makes it useful in conditions such as [[arthritis]] and other inflammatory diseases.
	- ### [[anti-cancer]] potential:
		- research has indicated that limonene may have anticancer properties. it has been found to induce apoptosis (programmed cell death) in cancer cells and inhibit tumor growth. this has been observed in various types of cancers, including [[breast cancer]], [[colorectal cancer]], and [[prostate cancer]]s.
	- ### [[antioxidant]]
		- limonene is a potent antioxidant, which helps in neutralizing free radicals in the body. this can prevent oxidative stress and reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as [[heart disease]] and [[neurodegenerative disorders]].
	- ### [[digestive]] aid:
		- limonene has been traditionally used to relieve symptoms of gastrointestinal distress, such as [[acid reflux]] and [[indigestion]]. it helps in promoting healthy digestion and can alleviate symptoms of [[bloating]] and [[stomach discomfort]].
	- ### potential in [[skin care]]
		- due to its anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties, limonene is used in various skin care products. it can help in treating [[acne]], [[eczema]], and other skin conditions by reducing inflammation and preventing bacterial infections.
