-
- cycloergostanol is a complex [[steroid derivative]] belonging to the class of [[phytosterols]] or ergostane-type steroids, often found in [[fungi]], [[lichens]], and some [[medicinal plants]]. structurally related to [[ergosterol]], cycloergostanol compounds have been studied for their potential [[anticancer]], [[antimicrobial]], and [[anti-inflammatory]] activities. they feature a [[cyclopropane ring]] and multiple methyl substitutions in their sterol backbone.
	- ### chemical properties
		- **molecular weight**: varies depending on side chains; typical derivatives ~470–490 g/mol
		- **structure**: tetracyclic sterol nucleus with cyclopropyl or methylated side groups
		- **melting point**: estimated range 160–190°C
		- **solubility**: lipid-soluble; insoluble in water
		- **chemical formula**: C₃₀H₅₀O (for common cycloergostanol acetate derivatives)
	- ### usefulness in medicine
		- cycloergostanol derivatives exhibit potential [[anticancer]] effects by inducing [[apoptosis]] and inhibiting [[cell proliferation]] in tumor cells.
		- they show [[anti-inflammatory]] activity, particularly by downregulating pro-inflammatory cytokines.
		- some compounds have demonstrated [[neuroprotective]] potential in preclinical studies.
		- used as lead structures for drug discovery in steroid-based pharmacology.
		- their bioactivity depends on structural variations like acetate esters or oxidation states.
	- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
		- certain cycloergostanol derivatives display [[broad-spectrum antimicrobial]] activity against [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], and even some [[protozoa]].
		- mechanisms include membrane disruption and enzyme inhibition.
