- [[carbohydrates]], commonly known as carbs, are organic molecules consisting of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. they are one of the primary macronutrients and serve as the body's main source of energy.
- ### chemical properties
	- **molecular structure**: composed of [[monosaccharides]] (simple sugars), [[disaccharides]], or [[polysaccharides]].
	- **molecular weight**: varies depending on the specific carbohydrate (e.g., glucose: 180.16 g/mol).
	- **solubility**: simple carbohydrates are highly soluble in water, while complex carbohydrates like cellulose are less soluble.
	- **chemical formula**: varies; general formula is (CH₂O)ₙ.
- ### usefulness in medicine
	- carbohydrates are the body’s primary source of [[energy]], particularly in the form of [[glucose]], which fuels cellular activities.
	- they are essential for [[brain function]], as glucose is the brain's preferred energy source.
	- complex carbohydrates contribute to [[digestive health]] by providing dietary fiber, which [[supports gut microbiota]] and regular [[bowel movements]].
	- carbohydrates play a role in managing [[blood sugar levels]] and are central to treating conditions like [[hypoglycemia]].
	- they are critical in [[sports nutrition]] for replenishing glycogen stores in muscles and enhancing athletic performance.
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- certain carbohydrate derivatives, such as [[oligosaccharides]] and [[polysaccharides]], exhibit [[antimicrobial]] properties by interfering with microbial adhesion and growth. research highlights:
