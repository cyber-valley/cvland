- ### usefulness in medicine
	- vitamin b2 is essential for preventing and treating [[riboflavin deficiency]], which can cause [[ariboflavinosis]], characterized by cracks at the corners of the mouth, sore throat, and sensitivity to light.
	- it supports [[healthy skin]], [[eyes]], and [[mucous membranes]].
	- it is used in managing [[migraine headaches]] and promoting energy metabolism.
	- riboflavin also plays a role in reducing [[oxidative stress]] by aiding in the regeneration of [[glutathione]], a powerful antioxidant.
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- vitamin b2 has been studied for its potential [[antimicrobial]] effects, primarily due to its role in [[boosting immune responses]] and disrupting bacterial metabolic pathways.
