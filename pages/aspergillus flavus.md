- aspergillus flavus is a pathogenic fungus belonging to the genus [[aspergillus]], known primarily for contaminating agricultural crops such as grains, nuts (especially peanuts), and spices. it produces toxic metabolites called [[aflatoxins]], potent carcinogens harmful to humans and animals
- ## diseases caused by aspergillus flavus
  id:: 68109a76-7875-4bb9-8bcb-92f060b4681f
	- [[aspergillosis]]: respiratory infections, particularly invasive in immunocompromised individuals
	- [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis]] (abpa): allergic reactions, asthma-like symptoms, inflammation of the lungs
	- food poisoning and hepatotoxicity due to aflatoxin ingestion, increasing risk of liver cancer
- ## habitats and transmission
	- environmental presence: soil, decaying vegetation, stored grains, nuts, spices
	- transmission: inhalation of airborne spores; ingestion of contaminated food products containing aflatoxins
- ## prevention and treatment
	- preventing fungal contamination through proper crop storage, moisture control, and good hygiene practices
	- antifungal medications (voriconazole, amphotericin b) used for treatment of invasive aspergillosis
	- prevention strategies include controlling humidity, temperature, and use of antifungal preservatives during food storage
