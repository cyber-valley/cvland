	- ## lifecycle
		- longevity: 4 years
		- germination: seeds germinate quickly within 7–14 days under warm (22–28°C), moist conditions
		- seedling: seedlings rapidly establish succulent foliage within 4–6 weeks after germination, requiring regular watering
		- mature: plants mature and produce flowers within 60–90 days, continually yielding edible leaves and seeds throughout growing season
		- death: gradually declines after 3–4 years or earlier under unfavorable conditions such as frost or prolonged drought

- ## operations
	- propagation: easily propagated by seeds or stem cuttings; cuttings root readily in moist soil or water within 7–10 days
	- maintenance: minimal care required; regular watering during drought, occasional organic fertilization enhances foliage and flower production
	- harvest: regularly harvest young edible leaves for consumption; flowers harvested for ornamental use or medicinal extracts; seeds harvested when capsules mature and dry
