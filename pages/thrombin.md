- thrombin is a vital [[serine protease enzyme]] that plays a key role in the [[coagulation cascade]] by converting [[fibrinogen]] into [[fibrin]], which forms the structural mesh of a [[blood clot]]. it is generated from its inactive precursor [[prothrombin]] through the action of [[factor xa]] in the presence of [[calcium ions]], [[phospholipids]], and [[factor v]]. thrombin also activates other coagulation factors and contributes to [[platelet activation]] and [[wound healing]].
	- ### chemical properties
		- **molecular weight**: ~37 kDa
		- **structure**: consists of two peptide chains (a and b) linked by disulfide bonds
		- **enzyme class**: serine protease (EC 3.4.21.5)
		- **activation**: formed from prothrombin cleavage by prothrombinase complex
	- ### usefulness in medicine
		- thrombin is central to the formation of stable blood clots and is essential for controlling [[bleeding]].
		- topical thrombin is used as a [[hemostatic agent]] during surgery to control minor bleeding.
		- thrombin is a key target for [[anticoagulant drugs]] (e.g., [[dabigatran]]) used to prevent or treat [[thrombosis]], [[stroke]], or [[atrial fibrillation]].
		- abnormal thrombin activity is associated with both [[excessive clotting]] and [[bleeding disorders]].
		- it also influences [[inflammation]] and [[tissue repair]] through signaling pathways beyond clot formation.
	- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
		- thrombin indirectly supports antimicrobial defense by helping form clots that trap pathogens at injury sites and reduce systemic spread.
		- fibrin generated by thrombin serves as a physical barrier that aids [[immune cells]] in localizing and neutralizing invaders.
