alias:: macula lutea

- the macula (also known as [[macula lutea]]) is a small, oval-shaped area near the center of the [[retina]] in the human eye, responsible for sharp central vision (also called high-acuity vision). it contains a high concentration of [[photoreceptor cells]], especially [[cone cells]], essential for detailed vision, color perception, reading, and recognizing faces.
- key functions:
	- detailed and sharp central vision
	- color perception
	- visual tasks like reading, driving, and face recognition
- structure:
	- contains the fovea, a small central pit densely packed with cones for maximum visual acuity.
	- high concentration of carotenoids ([[lutein]] and [[zeaxanthin]]) that protect against oxidative stress and [[blue-light damage]].
- associated conditions:
	- [[age-related macular degeneration (AMD)]]
	- [[macular edema]] (swelling)
	- [[macular hole]]
- maintaining macular health (e.g., through diet rich in carotenoids) helps preserve clear, sharp central vision.
