- stigmasterol is a naturally occurring [[phytosterol]] structurally related to cholesterol, commonly found in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, legumes, fruits, and medicinal plants. stigmasterol plays a significant role as a precursor in the biosynthesis of plant hormones such as [[brassinosteroids]], and possesses notable health-promoting properties.
- ## chemical properties
	- chemical formula: C₂₉H₄₈O
	- molecular weight: 412.69 g/mol
	- solubility: insoluble in water; soluble in fats, oils, and organic solvents
	- melting point: approximately 170°C
	- structure: steroid nucleus closely related to cholesterol, with an unsaturated side-chain
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- stigmasterol effectively lowers [[ldl cholesterol]] by competing with dietary cholesterol absorption, potentially reducing [[cardiovascular disease]] risk
	- exhibits anti-inflammatory effects, useful in managing conditions like [[arthritis]] and [[chronic inflammatory disorders]]
	- possesses [[anticancer]] potential, especially noted in breast, prostate, colon, and ovarian cancers
	- beneficial for hormone-related conditions due to its structural similarity to cholesterol and involvement in hormone metabolism
- ## [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- stigmasterol demonstrates antimicrobial effects through immune system modulation, inflammation reduction, and direct inhibition of microbial growth
	- bacteria:
		- [[staphylococcus aureus]]
		- [[escherichia coli]]
		- [[pseudomonas aeruginosa]]
	- fungi:
		- [[candida albicans]]
