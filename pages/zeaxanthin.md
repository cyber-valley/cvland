- zeaxanthin, chemically known as β,β-carotene-3,3’-diol, is a naturally occurring [[carotenoid pigment]] closely related to [[lutein]]. it accumulates primarily in the [[macula]] of the human retina, serving as a powerful antioxidant and protective agent against oxidative stress and harmful [[blue light exposure]]. zeaxanthin plays a critical role in maintaining [[vision clarity]], reducing the risk of [[age-related macular degeneration (AMD)]], and preventing the development of [[cataracts]].
- ## chemical properties
	- molecular weight: 568.87 g/mol
	- density: approximately 1.0 g/cm³
	- melting point: 203–205°C
	- solubility: soluble in fats, oils, and organic solvents; insoluble in water
	- optical rotation: +18° to +20° (in chloroform)
	- chemical formula: C₄₀H₅₆O₂
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- zeaxanthin supplementation supports [[eye health]] by significantly lowering the risk of developing [[AMD]], improving [[visual acuity]], and protecting against [[photodamage]].
	- due to its potent antioxidant properties, zeaxanthin also contributes to [[skin health]] by reducing oxidative damage from [[UV radiation]], thereby potentially slowing [[skin aging]].
	- recent research suggests zeaxanthin may support [[cognitive function]] by protecting neural cells from oxidative damage, possibly reducing the progression of neurodegenerative conditions like [[alzheimer’s disease]] .
	- zeaxanthin also aids immune function, improving resistance to [[inflammation]] and oxidative stress-related cellular damage.
	- [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
		- bacteria:
			- [[staphylococcus aureus]]
			- [[escherichia coli]]
		- zeaxanthin demonstrates antimicrobial activity primarily through its robust antioxidant capacity, enhancing the body’s natural defenses and inhibiting bacterial growth and virulence mechanisms.
