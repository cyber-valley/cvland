- beta-sitosterol is a naturally occurring [[phytosterol]] found in many plants, including nuts, seeds, fruits, and vegetables. it has a chemical structure similar to [[cholesterol]] and is known for its ability to reduce [[cholesterol absorption]] in the human gut. beta-sitosterol is used for supporting [[cardiovascular health]], managing symptoms of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia (bph)]], and enhancing [[immune function]].
	- ### chemical properties
		- **molecular weight**: 414.7 g/mol
		- **structure**: steroid nucleus with a side chain; structurally similar to cholesterol
		- **melting point**: ~137–139°C
		- **solubility**: insoluble in water; soluble in ethanol, chloroform, and oils
		- **chemical formula**: C₂₉H₅₀O
	- ### usefulness in medicine
		- beta-sitosterol helps lower [[ldl cholesterol]] levels by competing with dietary cholesterol for absorption.
		- it is used in the treatment of [[bph]] to improve urinary symptoms in men.
		- it has [[anti-inflammatory]] effects that may benefit people with [[arthritis]] and [[autoimmune conditions]].
		- beta-sitosterol is also investigated for potential [[anticancer]] effects, particularly in [[prostate]] and [[breast cancer]] models.
		- it may support [[immune balance]] and [[oxidative stress reduction]].
	- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
		- beta-sitosterol exhibits moderate antimicrobial effects against certain [[bacteria]] and [[fungi]].
		- it can disrupt microbial cell membranes and reduce inflammation caused by infection.
		- often works synergistically with other plant compounds in extracts.
