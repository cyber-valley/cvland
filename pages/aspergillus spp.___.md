- aspergillus spp. refers to a group of filamentous fungi widely found in the environment, commonly present in soil, decaying vegetation, food products, and indoor air. although most species are harmless environmental molds, certain aspergillus species can cause opportunistic infections known as [[aspergillosis]], particularly in immunocompromised individuals.
- ## diseases caused by aspergillus spp.:
	- [[aspergillosis]]: fungal infections ranging from mild allergic reactions to severe invasive diseases.
	- [[allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (abpa)]]: allergic respiratory condition characterized by inflammation, asthma-like symptoms, and breathing difficulties.
	- [[aspergilloma]]: fungal ball formation within existing lung cavities or sinuses, causing chronic cough and hemoptysis (coughing up blood).
	- [[invasive aspergillosis]]: severe systemic infection predominantly affecting immunocompromised patients, leading to tissue damage and high mortality rates.
	- [[cutaneous aspergillosis]]: skin infections, usually resulting from direct inoculation, causing ulcers and lesions.
- habitats and transmission:
	- environmental presence: soil, compost, dust, decaying plant material, foodstuffs.
	- transmission: primarily through inhalation of airborne spores; rarely via direct skin inoculation or ingestion of contaminated food.
- aspergillus infections are treated primarily with antifungal medications (e.g., voriconazole, amphotericin b). prevention involves reducing exposure in high-risk individuals by using air filtration systems, maintaining good hygiene, and promptly managing environmental mold contamination.
