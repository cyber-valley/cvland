alias:: modulus of rupture

- maximum load-carrying capacity in bending
- the breaking point of wood when subjected to a bending force
- measured in megapascals, MPa
- why important
	- critical for structural applications: beams, bridges, trusses
	- tells you how much bending a wood can take before it snaps
	- higher MOR = safer for heavy loads, longer spans, fewer supports
- related to [[wood]], [[concrete]]
- ## structural strength class (S1–S6)
  
  based on combined values for MOR (modulus of rupture), MOE (stiffness), and compressive strength — aligned with how wood is used *structurally* (posts, beams, load-bearing components)
