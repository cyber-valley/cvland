- environment
	- thrives in tropical to subtropical lowland to montane regions with seasonal rainfall and full sun
- [[climate]]: warm humid tropics to subtropics with seasonal dry period
	- sun:: 500–800 W/m²
	- no-sun-days:: 15
	- water:: 1200–2000 mm/year
	- no-water-days:: 30–60
	- humidity:: 60–90%
	- fog-resistance:: 20 days
	- max-temp:: 42°c
	- optimal-temp:: 25–32°c
	- min-temp:: 5°c
	- wind-damage:: [[cyclone]], [[storm-gust]]
- [[soil]]: well-drained loamy soils, but tolerant of clay and poor soils
	- soil-ph:: 5.5–7.5
	- soi-type:: [[loam]], [[clay-loam]], [[sandy-loam]], [[alluvial]]
- [[spacing]]: wide spacing due to large crown and lateral spread
	- good-neighbors:: [[coffea]], [[musa]], [[moringa]], [[gamal]]
	- bad-neighbors:: [[allelopathic]] species like [[eucalyptus]]
	- max-height:: 3000 cm
	- max-spread:: 2000 cm
- lifecycle
	- longevity:: 40–60 years
	- germination: seeds need scarification or soaking to break dormancy, germinate in 5–10 days
	- seedling: fast-growing, shade-tolerant in early stages
	- mature: forms broad canopy, begins flowering in 2–4 years
	- death: natural decline due to disease, old age, or extreme drought

- operations
	- [[propagation]]: primarily by seeds, which germinate well after hot water or acid treatment; can also propagate via root suckers or cuttings
	- [[maintenance]]: minimal; benefits from light pruning, especially in agroforestry; manage spacing to prevent canopy dominance
	- [[harvest]]:
		- for [[fuel]] and [[timber]]: harvest 5–10 year old stems
		- for [[fodder]]: cut leaves and twigs regularly
		- for [[green]]: mulch production by chop-and-drop of prunings
