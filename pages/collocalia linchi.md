- general description
	- appearance
		- the linchi swiftlet is a small, fast-flying bird with a uniformly dark, sooty-brown to blackish plumage.
		- it has a slightly paler underbelly, but overall, it lacks distinctive markings.
		- its wings are long and narrow, and its tail is slightly forked.
		- the legs are short and adapted for clinging to vertical surfaces rather than perching.
	- size
		- measures about 9-10 cm in length.
		- typically weighs around 8-10 grams.
	- behavior
		- known for its swift and agile flight, often seen flying rapidly and maneuvering deftly to catch insects.
		- spends most of its time on the wing, similar to other swiftlets.
		- emits high-pitched, twittering calls while in flight.
- habitat
	- range
		- found in southeast asia, particularly in indonesia on the islands of java, bali, and nearby smaller islands.
	- environment
		- inhabits a variety of environments including forests, coastal cliffs, caves, and sometimes urban areas.
	- often nests in caves and under the eaves of buildings.
- diet
	- primarily insectivorous, feeding on flying insects caught in flight.
	- capable of catching a large number of insects daily, contributing to natural pest control.
- breeding
	- nesting
		- builds a nest primarily of plant material and feathers glued together with saliva, typically placed on cave walls or under eaves.
		- nests are usually small, cup-shaped, and adhere to vertical surfaces.
	- reproduction
		- breeding season varies but often coincides with the availability of abundant food sources.
		- female lays 1-2 eggs, which are incubated for about 17-20 days.
		- both parents participate in feeding the chicks until they fledge, which takes about 30-35 days.
- conservation status
	- currently not considered endangered or vulnerable.
	- listed as least concern by the iucn due to its wide range and stable population.
- interesting facts
	- the linchi swiftlet is known for its echolocation ability, which it uses to navigate and find nests in the dark caves where it often roosts and breeds.
	- swiftlets are unique among birds for their use of echolocation, a trait more commonly associated with bats.
	- their nests are sometimes harvested for the production of bird's nest soup, a delicacy in some cultures, though sustainable practices are essential to avoid negative impacts on populations.
