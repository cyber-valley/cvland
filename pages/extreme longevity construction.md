- 🛡️ architectural rules for a truly eternal wall (target: 10,000–100,000+ years)
- blocks
	- block shape: **hexagonal prism**
	- block size:
	- flat-to-flat diameter: **30–40 cm**
	- block thickness: **20–25 cm**
	- block height per row: **15–25 cm**
	- block weight: **20–35 kg** (manageable manually)
	- material: pure basalt or comparable ultra-dense stone (density >2800 kg/m³)
- joints
	- joint thickness: **0.3–0.5 mm**
	- mortar: improved [[roman concrete]]
	- no organic additives: pure mineralization
	- joint firing
	- after laying, heat joints to **400–600 °c**
	- slow and even heating and cooling to avoid cracks
- block arrangement
	- alternating rows (every block overlaps at least 3 lower blocks)
	- honeycomb-type staggered pattern
	- special trimmed hexagonal blocks at corners
- roofing and drainage
	- roof overhang minimum **1.5 meters** on all sides
	- steep roof pitch: **>35°**
	- raised foundation: minimum **50 cm** above ground level
	- foundation sits on **40–50 cm** layer of coarse basalt gravel
	- full perimeter drainage system (channels or rock trenches)
- protection of joints and walls
	- thin mineral wash coating:
	- slaked lime + volcanic ash + basalt powder + water
	- applied in 2 thin layers (~0.5–1 mm total)
	- natural slow carbonation over centuries
	- no paints or synthetic seals allowed (they trap moisture)
- 🧬 evolution of the wall across epochs
	- | era | what happens | effect on the wall |
	  |:----|:-------------|:------------------|
	  | 0–10 years | initial micro-shrinkage and carbonation | pores close, mortar hardens, initial mineral bonding strengthens |
	  | 10–100 years | progressive crystallization and strengthening | wall becomes semi-monolithic, improved compressive strength |
	  | 100–1000 years | slow internal mineral growth | porosity decreases, structure self-heals minor imperfections |
	  | 1000–5000 years | complete inner pore stabilization | wall transitions into a synthetic rock, near-perfect mineral cohesion |
	  | 5000–10,000 years | surface micro-polishing by rain, wind | slight aesthetic smoothing, no structural damage |
	  | 10,000–100,000 years | geological-level stability phase | wall behaves as natural basalt formations, survival limited only by massive geological events |
- 🔥 laser cutting technology for ultra-thin basalt joints
	- high-power CO₂ laser or fiber laser
	- power requirement: 12–20 kW minimum
	- cutting speed: 2–10 mm/min
	- continuous water mist or inert gas (N₂, air) cooling required
	- ideally pre-heat the stone slightly to avoid thermal shock
- results
	- cutting precision: **<0.3 mm** joint tolerance
	- no mechanical vibration, no micro-cracks
	- highly polished contact surfaces
- practical notes
	- cutting should be done **on-site** if possible to avoid transportation damage
	- portable gantry systems or modular laser rails can be deployed
- ✨ final summary
	- hexagonal basalt blocks
	- laser-cut surfaces
	- ultra-thin joints: <0.5 mm
	- pure mineral mortar, no organics
	- joint firing after construction
	- wide roofs and perfect drainage
- result
	- a wall capable of lasting 100,000+ years
	- behaving more like a natural basalt cliff than a conventional structure
	- requiring almost zero maintenance for millennia
