- habitat
	- range
		- found in parts of south asia and southeast asia, including india, bhutan, nepal, myanmar, thailand, laos, and vietnam.
		- several subspecies are distributed across montane regions in these countries.
	- environment
		- inhabits montane and subtropical forests, preferring dense undergrowth and thick, moist habitats such as rhododendron thickets, bamboo groves, and forest edges.
		- often found at elevations ranging from 1,500 to 3,500 meters, depending on the region.
	- diet
		- primarily insectivorous, feeding on a variety of insects, spiders, and other small invertebrates.
		- forages mainly on the ground, turning over leaves and debris to uncover prey.

	- its elusive nature and preference for dense undergrowth make it a challenging bird to observe in the wild, often being heard more often than seen.
	- the species is well-adapted to high-altitude environments, thriving in cool, moist forest habitats.
