alias:: tetraterpenoids

- [[carotenoids]], also known as tetraterpenoids, are a diverse group of [[fat-soluble pigments]] naturally occurring in plants, algae, and photosynthetic bacteria. they serve essential roles as precursors of [[vitamin a]], antioxidants, and protective agents against photooxidative damage. carotenoids such as [[β-carotene]], [[lutein]], and [[zeaxanthin]] are vital for [[eye vision]], [[skin health]], and [[immune function]].
- ## chemical properties
	- molecular weight: approximately 536.87 g/mol (β-carotene)
	- density: 0.94 g/cm³ (β-carotene)
	- melting point: 180–183°C (β-carotene)
	- solubility: soluble in fats and organic solvents; insoluble in water
	- optical rotation: +448° to +461° (β-carotene, chloroform)
	- chemical formula: C₄₀H₅₆ (β-carotene)
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- carotenoids, especially [[β-carotene]], act as precursors to [[vitamin a]], preventing and treating [[vitamin a deficiency]] and associated conditions such as [[night blindness]].
	- [[lutein]] and [[zeaxanthin]] support eye health, significantly reducing the risk of [[age-related macular degeneration]] and [[cataracts]].
	- due to their strong [[antioxidant]] properties, carotenoids protect cells from oxidative stress, reducing inflammation and potentially lowering risks of [[cardiovascular disease]] and certain types of [[cancer]].
	- carotenoids also enhance the [[immune system]], supporting effective immune responses and decreasing susceptibility to [[infections]].
- [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- carotenoids exhibit antimicrobial activity primarily through their antioxidant and immune-enhancing properties, strengthening natural defense mechanisms.
