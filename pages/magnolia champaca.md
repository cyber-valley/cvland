- product
	- [[flower]]
- [magnolia_champaca](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnolia_champaca)
- [[high margin]]
- [[plant/type]]: flowering [[evergreen tree]]

		- leaf-length:: 15–25 cm
	- flower: fragrant, creamy white or yellow, blooms singly or in small clusters
		- petal-length:: 6–10 cm
	- fruit: aggregate of follicles, each containing red-coated [[seeds]]
	- bark: smooth, grey to light brown, [[aromatic]] when cut
	- timber: fine-grained, soft to medium-hard [[wood]], lightly [[fragrant]]
- environment:: tropical lowland and mid-elevation climates with rich, well-drained soils and consistent rainfall

	- operations
		- [[propagation]]: propagated via seeds (fresh, pre-treated), air-layering, or semi-hardwood cuttings; seedling method is slow but reliable
		- [[maintenance]]: mulch and protect young trees from drying winds; prune lightly after flowering to shape; avoid waterlogging; fertilize with compost and leaf mulch annually
		- [[harvest]]:
			- fresh flowers: collected daily in early morning during bloom seasons for [[perfumery]] or ceremonial use
			- [[essential oil]]: steam-distilled from fresh petals, yield is low (~0.1–0.3%) but highly [[aromatic]]
			- [[floral water]]: [[byproduct]] of [[distillation]] used in [[cosmetics]] and rituals
			- [[wood]]: harvested selectively after natural fall or pruning. used in artisanal [[woodcraft]], [[incense]], and [[carving]]
