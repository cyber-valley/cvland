tags:: nitrogenous plant metabolites

- alkaloids are naturally occurring organic compounds containing nitrogen, primarily found in plants, fungi, bacteria, and certain animals. characterized by their significant physiological and pharmacological activities, alkaloids often act as defense mechanisms against herbivores and pathogens.
- ## chemical properties
	- composition: nitrogen-containing organic bases, typically derived from amino acids
	- solubility: generally soluble in organic solvents; limited water solubility (varies widely)
	- taste: typically bitter
	- classification: based on structure (e.g., indole alkaloids, isoquinoline alkaloids, tropane alkaloids, pyrrolidine alkaloids)
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- alkaloids have diverse medicinal applications, including analgesic, [[anti-inflammatory]], [[antimicrobial]], [[antimalarial]] [[anticancer]], and [[neuroactive]] effects.
	- notable alkaloids include:
		- [[morphine]] (pain relief),
		- [[quinine]] (antimalarial),
		- [[caffeine]] (stimulant),
		- [[atropine]] (anticholinergic), and
		- [[vincristine]] (anticancer agent).
- ## [[antimicrobial]] and therapeutic activity
	- many alkaloids exhibit direct antimicrobial activity against a variety of pathogens by disrupting cell membranes, inhibiting enzyme function, or interfering with microbial replication.
	- bacteria:
		- [[escherichia coli]]
		- [[staphylococcus aureus]]
		- [[salmonella spp.]]
		- [[pseudomonas aeruginosa]]
	- fungi:
		- [[candida albicans]]
		- [[aspergillus spp.]]
- parasites:
	- [[plasmodium falciparum]] (malaria parasite)
