- brassinosteroids are a class of steroidal plant hormones derived from [[phytosterols]] such as [[campesterol]], [[sitosterol]], and [[stigmasterol]]. they regulate numerous essential processes in plant development, growth, stress responses, and immunity, acting similarly to animal steroid hormones but uniquely in plants
- ## chemical properties
	- structure: steroid core structure with multiple hydroxyl groups
	- primary brassinosteroid: [[brassinolide]]
	- solubility: insoluble in water; soluble in organic solvents (ethanol, methanol, chloroform)
	- biosynthesis: derived through enzymatic oxidation of phytosterol precursors
- ## role in plant physiology
	- stimulate cell elongation, division, and differentiation
	- promote root and shoot growth, seed germination, flowering, and fruit maturation
	- enhance plant resilience to environmental stresses (drought, salinity, temperature extremes)
	- improve plant defense mechanisms against pests and pathogens
- ## usefulness in agriculture and medicine
	- widely applied in agriculture as natural growth-promoting substances to enhance crop yields, quality, and stress tolerance
	- potential therapeutic applications include [[anti-inflammatory]], [[antioxidant]], [[antiviral]], and [[anticancer]] activities in humans, although research is ongoing
