alias:: IGG, igg
tags:: vital glycoprotein

- immunoglobulin g is the most abundant [[antibody]] class in the human body, comprising about 75% of all serum antibodies. it is a vital [[glycoprotein]] produced by [[b cells]] and plays a central role in the [[adaptive immune system]]. igg is responsible for identifying and neutralizing [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], and [[toxins]]. it can cross the [[placenta]], providing passive immunity to newborns.
	- ### chemical properties
		- **molecular weight**: ~150 kDa
		- **structure**: Y-shaped molecule with two [[antigen-binding (fab)]] regions and one [[fc region]]
		- **glycosylation**: n-linked glycan on the fc region affects immune activity
		- **half-life in serum**: ~21 days
		- **subclasses**: igg1, igg2, igg3, igg4 â€” each with specialized functions
	- ### usefulness in medicine
		- igg provides long-term protection following [[infection]] or [[vaccination]].
		- it is used in [[passive immunotherapy]] to treat [[infections]], [[autoimmune diseases]], and [[immunodeficiencies]].
		- intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is a therapeutic preparation of pooled igg from healthy donors.
		- low igg levels (hypogammaglobulinemia) can lead to [[recurrent infections]].
		- elevated igg may indicate [[chronic inflammation]], [[autoimmune disease]], or [[multiple myeloma]].
	- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
		- igg binds to [[pathogen antigens]], marking them for [[phagocytosis]] and activating the [[complement system]].
		- it neutralizes bacterial toxins and prevents virus entry into host cells.
		- igg plays a key role in [[antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC)]], aiding in the destruction of infected or abnormal cells.
