alias:: unified structure

- stratification = layered unfolding
- time and space are one ecological fabric
- everything grows in relation: vertical and temporal
	- [[layers]]: spatial vertical coexistence
		- upper = light capturers, future giants
		- middle = stabilizers, flexible connectors
		- lower = nurturers, cover, nutrient recyclers
	- [[succession]]: temporal sequence of ecological roles
		- early = pioneers, builders
		- mid = diversifiers, enrichers
		- late = stabilizers, balancers
- understanding stratification enables:
	- optimal placement of species
	- guiding the future shape of a biome
	- recognizing roles in context: now and later
