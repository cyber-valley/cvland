alias:: phylloquinone

- vitamin k1 (also known as [[phylloquinone]]) is a vital [[fat-soluble vitamin]] that plays a key role in [[blood clotting]], [[bone metabolism]], and the regulation of [[calcium levels]] in the blood. it is primarily found in green leafy vegetables and is essential for the synthesis of clotting factors in the liver.

	- ### usefulness in medicine
		- vitamin k1 is essential for the production of [[prothrombin]], a protein and clotting factor that is critical in [[blood coagulation]].
		- it supports [[bone health]] by helping regulate [[osteocalcin]], a protein that binds calcium to the bone matrix.
		- it plays a role in preventing [[vascular calcification]], thereby supporting [[cardiovascular health]].
		- vitamin k1 is used medically to treat or prevent [[vitamin k deficiency bleeding]] in newborns and patients with [[malabsorption syndromes]] or on [[blood thinners]] like warfarin.
		- adequate intake contributes to maintaining healthy [[arterial flexibility]] and may reduce the risk of [[fractures]] in older adults.
	- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
		- vitamin k1 is not directly [[antibacterial]], but its role in supporting [[immune function]] and [[tissue repair]] indirectly strengthens the body's defense.
		- its antioxidant properties help maintain [[cell membrane integrity]] during microbial infections.
