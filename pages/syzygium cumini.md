	- **plant, harvest, pruning calendar in months**
		- planting is best done at the beginning of the [[rainy season]] to ensure good establishment.
		- pruning can be done [[annually]] to maintain tree shape and promote healthy growth.
		- flowering typically occurs in [[late spring]] to [[early summer]], with fruit ripening in mid to [[late summer]] .
	- **good neighbors**: good companion plants for syzygium cumini include [[nitrogen-fixing]] plants like [[legumes]], ground covers that help retain [[soil]] moisture, and herbs or flowers that [[attract pollinators]].
	- **bad neighbors**: java plum trees should not be planted near [[crops]] that require [[full sunlight]] for optimal growth, as their dense [[canopy]] can create too much [[shade]]. they should also be kept away from plants susceptible to the same [[pests]] and [[diseases]].
