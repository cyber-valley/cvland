	- operations
		- [[propagation]]: mainly by fresh seed. vegetative methods include softwood grafting and budding for cultivar maintenance
		- [[maintenance]]: light pruning to manage crown shape and remove dead branches. [[mulch]] and [[compost]] around base. irrigation during dry periods in early years
		- [[harvest]]:
			- fruit: handpicked from branches when deep purple and soft (seasonally, 1–2 flushes/year)
			- seed: collected from pulp waste, dried, ground into powder for [[medicinal]] use
			- bark and leaf: harvested selectively for [[infusions]] or [[decoctions]]
			- timber: harvested from old trees. used in [[carpentry]], [[tools]], and rural [[construction]]
