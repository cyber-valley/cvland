- ## epoxy adhesive
	- best for: structural applications requiring maximum strength and rigidity
	- strengths: very high bond strength, excellent chemical resistance, low shrinkage
	- limitations:
		- rigid (can crack under impact)
		- requires precise mixing
		- higher cost
- ## polyurethane adhesive: [github discussion](https://github.com/cyber-valley/rockets/issues/1023)
	- best for: applications requiring flexibility and impact resistance
	- strengths: high flexibility, excellent impact absorption, easier application
	- limitations
		- moderate shrinkage
		- moisture-sensitive storage
		- lower temperature resistance
- ## epoxy vs polyurethane adhesive comparison
	- ## chemical properties
		- | feature | epoxy adhesive | polyurethane adhesive |
		  | chemical basis | epoxy resin + hardener (2-component) | polyurethane polymer (often moisture-cure, single or 2-component) |
		  | bond strength | very high, rigid, structural bonds | high, flexible to moderately rigid bonds |
		  | flexibility | low (rigid after cure) | moderate to high (retains elasticity) |
		  | shrinkage | very low | moderate (some shrinkage during curing) |
	- ## performance characteristics
		- | feature | epoxy adhesive | polyurethane adhesive |
		  |-------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
		  | impact resistance | lower (can fracture under impact) | high (absorbs vibration and impacts well) |
		  | water resistance | excellent after curing | excellent after curing |
		  | uv resistance | moderate (requires protective coatings) | good (some formulations excellent) |
		  | temperature resistance | high (~100–150°c), varies by product | moderate (~80–120°c), varies by product |
		  | chemical resistance | excellent against many chemicals | good but slightly lower than epoxy |
	- ## application properties
		- | feature | epoxy adhesive | polyurethane adhesive |
		  | curing time | variable (minutes to hours), typically faster, adjustable by component ratios | typically slower moisture cure (hours to a day), not easily adjusted |
		  | application ease | requires accurate mixing (2-component), sensitive to ratios | simpler, usually single-component ready-to-use |
		  | adhesion surfaces | excellent on metals, composites, ceramics, concrete | excellent on metals, glass, wood, plastics |
		  | shelf life/storage | longer shelf life, separate components (months to years) | limited once opened; sensitive to moisture |
	- ## environmental & economic factors
		- | feature | epoxy adhesive | polyurethane adhesive |
		  | environmental concerns | uncured resins/hardeners toxic, irritant; safe after full curing | uncured contains isocyanates; hazardous before curing, safe after full curing |
		  | microplastic potential | minimal (rigid, stable polymer - degradation over 50-100+ years) | moderate (elastic polymer prone to gradual degradation over 20-40 years) |
		  | price | higher ($15-40 per 100ml) | moderate ($8-25 per 100ml) |
