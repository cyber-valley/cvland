- [[proteins]] are large, complex molecules made up of [[amino acids]] that perform a wide variety of functions in the body. they are essential for structure, function, and regulation of tissues and organs, serving as [[enzymes]], [[hormones]], and [[antibodies]].
- ### chemical properties
	- **molecular structure**: composed of amino acids linked by [[peptide]] bonds, forming [[polypeptides]] that fold into specific three-dimensional shapes.
	- **molecular weight**: varies significantly depending on the protein (e.g., [[hemoglobin]]: ~64,500 g/mol).
	- **solubility**: solubility depends on the protein and its environment (e.g., pH, temperature); proteins can be soluble (e.g., [[albumin]]) or insoluble (e.g., [[keratin]]).
	- **chemical formula**: varies; general composition includes carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sometimes sulfur (CHON).
- ### usefulness in medicine
	- proteins are vital for [[muscle repair]] and [[growth]], making them crucial for athletes and those recovering from injuries.
	- they play a central role in [[enzyme production]], which facilitates biochemical reactions in the body.
	- proteins like [[antibodies]] are essential for [[immune defense]] against pathogens.
	- structural proteins like [[collagen]] and [[keratin]] maintain skin, hair, nails, and connective [[tissue health]].
	- therapeutic proteins, such as [[insulin]] and [[monoclonal antibodies]], are used to treat diseases like diabetes and cancer.
- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- certain proteins, such as [[defensins]] and [[lysozymes]], exhibit direct antimicrobial activity by disrupting microbial cell walls and membranes. research highlights:

- **[[hemoglobin]]**: transports oxygen in the blood.
- **[[myosin]]**: involved in muscle contraction and movement.
- **[[collagen]]**: provides structure to skin, bones, and connective tissues.
- **[[keratin]]**: strengthens hair, skin, and nails.
- **[[insulin]]**: regulates blood sugar levels.
- **[[albumin]]**: maintains fluid balance in the blood and carries hormones, vitamins, and enzymes.
- **[[fibrinogen]]**: essential for blood clotting.
- **[[amylase]]**: breaks down carbohydrates into sugars during digestion.
- **[[trypsin]]**: aids in protein digestion in the small intestine.
- **[[antibodies]] ([[immunoglobulins]])**: help the immune system fight infections.
- **[[actin]]**: works with myosin for cell movement and muscle contraction.
- **[[elastin]]**: provides elasticity to tissues like skin and blood vessels.
- **[[cytochrome c]]**: involved in energy production within mitochondria.
- **[[casein]]**: a protein found in milk, providing essential amino acids.
- **[[lysozyme]]**: destroys bacterial cell walls, offering antimicrobial defense.
- **[[enzymes]]**: catalyze biochemical reactions in the body (e.g., lactase for lactose digestion).
- **[[monoclonal antibodies]]**: laboratory-made proteins used in treating diseases like cancer.
- **[[hormones]]**: protein-based signaling molecules (e.g., growth hormone).
- **[[transport proteins]]**: facilitate the movement of molecules (e.g., sodium-potassium pump).
