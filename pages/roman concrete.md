- recipe for extreme longevity concrete with high thermal resistance
- | component | bahasa name | weight (kg) | volume (liters) | density (kg/m³) | function |
  |:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
  | slaked lime paste | kapur sirih | 9.6 | ~6 | ~1600 | primary binder |
  | volcanic ash | abu vulkanik | 14.4 | ~9.6 | ~1500 | pozzolanic reaction |
  | milled basalt powder | bubuk basal halus | 7.2 | ~4.8 | ~1500 | microfiller, structure |
  | kaolin clay | lempung kaolin | 4.8 | ~3.2 | ~1500 | thermal stability |
  | fine wood ash | abu kayu halus | 2.4 | ~1.9 | ~1200 | secondary pozzolanic action |
  | clean water | air bersih | ~6.0 | ~6.0 | 1000 | activation of reaction |
- instructions for preparation and use
	- mix dry components thoroughly: volcanic ash, milled basalt, kaolin clay, fine wood ash
	- separately prepare the slaked lime paste (kapur sirih) if not yet ready
	- combine dry mix with slaked lime paste
	- gradually add clean water, adjusting until achieving thick sour cream consistency
	- mix well for at least 5 minutes until homogeneous
	- optionally let the mortar rest for 1–2 hours under wet cloth to improve workability
	- slightly moisten basalt blocks before laying
	- apply a thin mortar layer (~3 mm) on one face only
	- press blocks together firmly with gentle tapping
	- continuously control block alignment and level
	- after construction, cover the wall with wet cloth or mist regularly for at least 7–10 days to ensure proper curing
- summary
	- mortar volume needed: ~30 liters per 1 m³ of basalt block wall (with 3 mm joints)
	- approximate total mortar mass: 45–50 kg
	- final mortar density after curing: 1650–1750 kg/m³
	- this concrete enable 100k years [[extreme longevity construction]]
