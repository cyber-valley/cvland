- where density is cool
	- high-load beams and posts: compression and bending
	- posts and docks => wet exposure
	- flooring and handles => dents and abrasion
	- [[charcoal]] and [[biochar]] => energy content
	- dense fibers => natural termite resistance
	- combustibility => |  higher density = burns slower
- trade-offs
	- [[tensegrity]]
	- ease of sawing
	- scaffolding
	- high-elevation transport
	- food dryers
	- thermal insulation => lower density = better insulation
