alias:: parkinson

- parkinsonâ€™s disease is a progressive [[neurodegenerative disorder]] characterized by the gradual loss of dopamine-producing neurons, primarily in the [[substantia nigra]] region of the brain. dopamine deficiency disrupts normal motor function, resulting in characteristic symptoms and affecting quality of life significantly.
- ## symptoms:
	- tremors (typically starting in one hand)
	- rigidity or stiffness of limbs and trunk
	- slowness of movement ([[bradykinesia]])
	- impaired balance and coordination
	- gait disturbances, including shuffling walk
	- non-motor symptoms: cognitive decline, sleep disorders, mood disorders, loss of smell
- ## causes and risk factors:
	- exact cause unknown; combination of genetic and environmental factors
	- genetic predisposition in some cases (mutations in genes such as [[SNCA]], [[LRRK2]], [[PARK7]])
	- age (most common in people over 60)
	- environmental exposures (pesticides, herbicides, heavy metals)
- ## treatment:
	- currently no cure; treatment focuses on symptom management:
	- medications to increase dopamine levels ([[levodopa]], dopamine agonists)
	- supportive therapies (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy)
	- surgical interventions ([[deep brain stimulation]]) in advanced cases
