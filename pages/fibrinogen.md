tags:: vital protein

- [[fibrinogen]] is a vital [[glycoprotein]] produced by the [[liver]] that plays a central role in [[blood clot formation]]. it circulates in the plasma as a soluble protein and is converted by [[thrombin]] into insoluble [[fibrin]] strands, which weave into a [[mesh]] to stabilize blood clots. fibrinogen is also involved in [[inflammation]], [[wound healing]], and acts as a binding agent for [[platelets]].
	- ### chemical properties
		- **molecular weight**: ~340 kDa
		- **structure**: composed of three pairs of polypeptide chains (Aα, Bβ, and γ)
		- **synthesis site**: liver
		- **plasma concentration**: normally 2–4 g/L in healthy individuals
		- **chemical formula**: complex protein; not represented by a simple formula
	- ### usefulness in medicine
		- fibrinogen is essential for the final step in the [[coagulation cascade]]—forming the [[fibrin clot]].
		- levels are measured to assess [[bleeding disorders]], [[liver disease]], [[inflammation]], and [[cardiovascular risk]].
		- elevated fibrinogen is a marker of [[systemic inflammation]] and linked to [[heart disease]], [[stroke]], and [[cancer]].
		- low fibrinogen (hypofibrinogenemia) can result in [[poor clot formation]] and [[excessive bleeding]].
		- used in clinical settings as [[fibrinogen concentrate]] or [[cryoprecipitate]] to treat patients with bleeding complications or [[massive hemorrhage]].
	- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
		- fibrinogen contributes to host defense by promoting [[clot formation]] that limits pathogen spread.
		- fibrin can trap [[bacteria]] at the site of infection and aid in immune cell recruitment.
		- certain pathogens interact with fibrinogen to evade the immune system, making it relevant in [[host-pathogen interactions]].
