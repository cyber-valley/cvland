- emerging interdisciplinary field
- focused on modifying and optimizing ecosystems
- to meet human needs
- restore natural balance
- and create sustainable, self-sufficient environments
- this is an area we are specifically focused
- in the following months we are going to post tons of useful information on the topic
- methods
  collapsed:: true
	- [[magic forest]]: bootstrapping amazing ecosystem using affordable low tech methods
	- genetics: modifying organisms to enhance ecological functions
	- restoration: reintroducing native species and rebuilding habitats to restore damaged ecosystems like forests and wetlands
	- bioremediation: using lifeforms to clean polluted environments by breaking down or absorbing contaminants
	- modeling: using computer simulations to predict and optimize biome structure
	- robonomics: employing sensor, drone and neural networks to optimize biome net output
	- aquaponics: growing plants in space-efficient  environments, integrated with sustainable fish farming
	- carbon sequestration: enhancing ecosystems’ ability to store carbon through reforestation, soil management, and biochar use
	- green infrastructure: incorporating natural elements into urban design to manage stormwater, improve air quality, and reduce heat
	- regeneration: farming methods like no-till and cover cropping that restore soil health and increase biodiversity
	- biomimicry: designing sustainable solutions inspired by nature, like energy-efficient buildings and water filtration systems
