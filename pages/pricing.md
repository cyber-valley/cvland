	- logistics: remote high-slope access means shuttle, e-bike rental, baggage storage, and wet-season shelters must be obvious or reviewers will complain
	  soft entry product” between free trails and paid hubs—e.g. low-cost ranger-guided forest quest or sunrise cacao circle
	- edem’s 500 + species is unique yet needs storytelling (way-markers, qr audio guides, “taste the leaf” kiosks) to convert visits into workshops & plant sales
	- free nature trails build massive footfall but risk cannibalising paid zones if value ladder is unclear
		- keys to keep free traffic feeding paid experiences, not cannibalising them:
		  	•	way-finding that turns every free path into a teaser: signposts reading “glow deeper tonight at sinwood → scan for half-price after dark”
		  	•	stamp-card or wristband: collect three trail stamps, swap them for a discounted paid hub ticket at the exit
		  	•	story progression: free areas tell chapter one; paid hubs unlock chapter two (interactive light, tastings, crafts) so curiosity pushes conversion
		  	•	staff touch-points: roaming rangers offering sneak-peek photos of sinwood or etherland on tablets with instant booking buttons
		  	•	time-based flow: schedule free highlights in early morning and late afternoon, then open ticketed zones when visitors are warming up, not exhausted
	- a single night-only hero (sinwood) leaves daylight monetisation gaps; think daytime micro-ateliers (mushroom dye, bamboo joinery, ‘code-in-the-canopy’ desks)
	- etherland packs many functions; without curated programming it can feel generic gym-plus-cowork
