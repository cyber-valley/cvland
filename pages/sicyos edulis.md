	- •	perennial climbing [[vine]], vigorous cucurbit species, commonly known as “caihua” or “chayote”; grows up to 5 meters, with slender stems, tendrils, deeply lobed leaves, small greenish-white flowers, and fleshy, hollow fruits.
	- •	roots: fibrous, shallow-rooting system.
		- •	compounds: [[saponins]] (medium), [[alkaloids]] (low)
	- •	leaves: large, palmate, deeply lobed, with soft hairs.
		- •	compounds: [[flavonoids]] (medium), [[tannins]] (low), [[saponins]] (medium)
	- •	flowers: small, greenish-white, clustered; monoecious (separate male and female flowers).
		- •	compounds: [[flavonoids]] (medium), [[phenolics]] (low)
	- •	fruits: elongated, hollow, green pods; edible when immature; becomes fibrous upon maturity.
		- •	compounds: dietary [[fiber]] (high), [[vitamin C]] (medium), [[saponins]] (medium), [[cucurbitacins]] (trace)
	- •	bark/stem: slender, green, flexible stems, covered with fine hairs.
		- •	compounds: [[fiber]] (medium), [[saponins]] (medium)
	- •	timber: none (herbaceous vine)
		- •	compounds: none
	- •	environment:: prefers subtropical to tropical, moist climates; well-drained, fertile soils.
	- •	climate:: warm, humid subtropical or tropical mountain climates without frost.
	- •	sun:: 600–900 W/m²
		- •	no-sun-days:: 7
	- •	water:: 800–1200 mm
		- •	no-water-days:: 21
	- •	humidity:: 60–85%
	- •	fog-resistance:: 60 days
	- •	max-temp:: 35°C
	- •	optimal-temp:: 16–24°C
	- •	min-temp:: 4°C
	- •	wind-damage:: [[wind/storm]], [[wind/hurricane]]
	- •	soil:: prefers fertile, organic-rich loam soils with good moisture retention and drainage.
	- •	soil-ph:: 5.5–7.5
	- •	soi-type:: [[soil/loam]], [[soil/sandy-loam]], [[soil/clay-loam]]
	- •	spacing:: optimal spacing is 50–100 cm between plants; climbing support needed.
	- •	good-neighbors::
	- •	bad-neighbors::
	- •	max-height:: 500 cm
	- •	max-spread:: 300 cm
	- •	lifecycle
		- •	longevity:: 3–5 years
		- •	germination:: seeds germinate rapidly (7–14 days) at temperatures above 15°C; soaking seeds can accelerate germination.
		- •	seedling:: fast-growing seedlings require protection from extreme weather and herbivores; climb quickly once established.
		- •	mature:: vigorous vine growth; prolific fruiting within 3–4 months after planting; continuous harvesting prolongs productivity.
		- •	death:: plants decline after 3–5 years; sensitive to prolonged drought, frost, or severe pest infestations.

	- Legend:
		- •	High: abundant presence
		- •	Medium: notable presence
		- •	Low: minimal presence
		- •	Trace: very minor detectable amounts
		- •	None: absent or negligible
	- •	operations
		- •	[[propagation]]:: easily propagated from seeds directly sown into soil or seedlings transplanted after germination; vegetative propagation possible by stem cuttings but less common.
		- •	[[maintenance]]:: regular watering, mulching to maintain moisture; periodic pruning to encourage new growth; requires climbing supports; pest monitoring recommended.
		- •	[[harvest]]:: fruits harvested young (5–15 cm), when tender and crisp; frequent harvesting promotes extended fruit production; mature fruits become fibrous and less palatable but seeds remain viable.

	- ### notes:
		- chayote fruits are low in calories, fat, and protein, but rich in dietary fiber and vitamin C.
		- they are valued for their nutritional benefits, aiding digestion and supporting immune function.
		- typically consumed fresh, cooked, stuffed, or pickled.
		- cooking methods like boiling slightly decrease vitamin C, dietary fiber, and mineral content.
		- cooking softens fibers, improving digestibility and palatability.
		- nutritionally remains beneficial, retaining most micronutrients.
