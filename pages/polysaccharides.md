- polysaccharides are large, complex carbohydrate molecules composed of long chains of monosaccharide units linked by glycosidic bonds. they serve critical biological roles as energy storage compounds ([[starch]], [[glycogen]]) and structural components ([[cellulose]], [[chitin]]) in plants, fungi, animals, and microorganisms.
- ## chemical properties
	- composition: repeated monosaccharide units (e.g., glucose, fructose, galactose, xylose, mannose)
	- solubility: varies significantly; some are water-soluble (e.g., gums, mucilages), others insoluble (e.g., cellulose, chitin)
	- molecular weight: very high, often ranging from thousands to millions of daltons
	- viscosity: high viscosity in aqueous solutions for soluble polysaccharides, influencing texture and stability
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- polysaccharides exhibit immunomodulatory properties, enhancing immune response and reducing inflammation (e.g., [[beta-glucans]], mushroom polysaccharides).
	- soluble polysaccharides (such as gums and mucilages) aid [[gastrointestinal health]], reducing [[cholesterol levels]], stabilizing [[blood sugar]] , and supporting digestive function.
	- polysaccharides from aloe vera, mushrooms, and seaweed are widely used in traditional medicine to promote [[wound healing]], [[skin hydration]], and tissue regeneration.
	- [[antimicrobial]] and therapeutic activity
	- polysaccharides demonstrate antimicrobial activity through immune system modulation, barrier formation, and direct inhibitory effects on bacterial adhesion and biofilm formation.
