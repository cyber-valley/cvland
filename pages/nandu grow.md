- ## Questions
	- how to choose the land?
		- current land available is the [[bridge]]
		- once bridge is established we will open access to other land
		- [[bridge]] is 7.5 ha of land
			- 5 ha never have been fertilized and have productive garden
			- 2.5 ha are likely was fertilized and does not have garden

	- can i work on the piece of land with the team?
		- yes, but you manage your team yourself
		- and take all the risks regarding the team
		- nandu program is a leadership program
		- so for one piece of land only one main leader can be assigned
	- what happens if the land is sold?
		- in such case you are loosing all your labor efforts as in the case with usual nandu
		- however in cyber nandu all accumulated investments are returned to a steward
		- e.g. you spend 10 mil for a pond or space for animals, they will be returned
		- after sale [[cve]] can offer other opportunities
	- what happens if i will be fired from [[cve]]?
		- it depends,
		- in some cases you can continue to work on your land
		- in some - you are loosing the access to the land
		- in any case all accumulated investments are returned to you, the steward
	- what happens if i plant long term crops but stewards of piece of land changed?
		- the general rules is that current stewards who make yield decide how to distribute earnings, including past stewards
		- all history of stewards is known
		- so if you plant [[santalum album]], but someone in the future cut it
		- these steward from the future can decide to honor you, the steward who plant it
		- that is how you can get return on your long term investments
		- its really hard to account for all the trees, so we rely more on thanksgiving culture
	- how to apply?
		- currently the program is only for workers of [[cve]]
		- later we will open the program for everyone
		- if you are a worker you have access to chat in telegram
		- go to [nandu grow](https://t.me/c/2245058785/16063) topic
		- the information to start is there
		- you can ask any question there
