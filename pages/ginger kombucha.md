- ## 📝 Step-by-step Instructions
- ### 1. Prepare Sweet Tea Base
	- Brew tea (black or green) in hot water (80–95°C).
	- Stir in coconut sugar until fully dissolved.
	- Allow tea to cool completely (**essential!**).
- ### 2. Start Fermentation
	- Pour cooled sweet tea into a clean glass jar (1.5–2 liters capacity).
	- Add SCOBY and starter kombucha (100–150 ml).
	- Cover jar with breathable cloth or cheesecloth, secured by a rubber band.
- ### 3. Primary Fermentation
	- Keep jar in a warm spot (**22–28°C), away from direct sunlight.
	- Ferment for **7–14 days** (ideally ~10 days).
	- A new SCOBY layer will form. Kombucha will taste tangy and less sweet.
- ### 4. Second Fermentation (Flavoring & Carbonation)
	- Remove SCOBY (save for next batch).
	- Strain kombucha into airtight bottles, leaving a small headspace.
	- Add freshly grated ginger (**~1 tsp per 500 ml**).
	- Optionally add a small amount of coconut sugar (**½ tsp per bottle**) for extra fizz.
	- Seal tightly and ferment at room temperature for an additional **2–4 days**.
- ### 5. Storage & Enjoyment
	- After secondary fermentation, refrigerate bottles.
	- Serve chilled and enjoy your bubbly kombucha!
