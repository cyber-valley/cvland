- ## 📝 step-by-step Instructions
- ### 1. prepare sweet tea base
	- brew tea (black or green) in hot water (80–95°C).
	- stir in coconut sugar until fully dissolved.
	- allow tea to cool completely (**essential!**).
- ### 2. start [[fermentation]]
	- pour cooled sweet tea into a clean glass jar (1.5–2 liters capacity).

	- cover jar with breathable cloth or cheesecloth, secured by a rubber band.
- ### 3. primary fermentation
	- keep jar in a warm spot (**22–28°C), away from direct sunlight.
	- ferment for **7–14 days** (ideally ~10 days).
	- a new SCOBY layer will form. Kombucha will taste tangy and less sweet.
- ### 4. second fermentation (flavoring & carbonation)
	- remove SCOBY (save for next batch).
	- strain kombucha into airtight bottles, leaving a small headspace.
	- add freshly grated ginger (**~1 tsp per 500 ml**).
	- optionally add a small amount of coconut sugar (**½ tsp per bottle**) for extra fizz.
	- seal tightly and ferment at room temperature for an additional **2–4 days**.
- ### 5. storage & enjoyment
	- after secondary fermentation, refrigerate bottles.
	- serve chilled and enjoy your bubbly kombucha!
- ## 💡 tips
	- always use glass containers and avoid contact with metal utensils.
