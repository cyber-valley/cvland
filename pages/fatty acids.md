tags:: carboxylic acids, lipid components

- fatty acids are organic compounds composed of a hydrocarbon chain terminating with a carboxyl group (â€“COOH). they are crucial components of lipids, essential for energy storage, cellular membrane structure, hormone synthesis, and signaling processes in living organisms.
- ## chemical properties
	- structure: hydrocarbon chains (saturated or unsaturated), carboxyl functional group
	- solubility: insoluble in water; soluble in organic solvents and fats
	- classification: saturated (no double bonds), monounsaturated (one double bond), polyunsaturated (multiple double bonds)
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- fatty acids, especially [[omega-3]] and [[omega-6]], have important roles in maintaining cardiovascular health, reducing inflammation, supporting neurological function, and regulating metabolism.
	- essential fatty acids, such as [[linoleic acid]] and [[alpha-linolenic acid]], are critical for brain development, skin health, immune function, and the prevention of chronic diseases.
	- fatty acids influence hormonal balance, impacting reproductive health and cellular growth.
- ## [[antimicrobial]] and therapeutic activity
	- certain fatty acids (e.g., lauric acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid) exhibit direct antimicrobial effects against bacteria, fungi, and viruses, mainly through disruption of microbial cell membranes.
	- bacteria:
		- [[staphylococcus aureus]]
		- [[streptococcus pyogenes]]
		- [[escherichia coli]]
		- [[pseudomonas aeruginosa]]
	- fungi:
		- [[candida albicans]]
	- viruses:
		- [[influenza]],
		- [[herpes simplex virus]]
	- ## saturated fatty acids:
		- [[butyric acid]]
		- [[caproic acid]]
		- [[caprylic acid]]
		- [[capric acid]]
		- [[lauric acid]]
		- [[myristic acid]]
		- [[palmitic acid]]
		- [[stearic acid]]
		- [[arachidic acid]]
		- [[behenic acid]]
	- ## monounsaturated fatty acids (mufa):
		- [[palmitoleic acid]]
		- [[oleic acid]]
		- [[vaccenic acid]]
	- ## polyunsaturated fatty acids (pufa):
		- [[linoleic acid]]
		- [[alpha-linolenic acid]]
		- [[gamma-linolenic acid (gla)]]
		- [[arachidonic acid (aa)]]
		- [[eicosapentaenoic acid (epa)]]
		- [[docosahexaenoic acid (dha)]]
	- ## essential fatty acids:
		- [[linoleic acid]]
		- [[alpha-linolenic acid]]
	- ## fatty acids with notable antimicrobial activity:
	- [[lauric acid]]
	- [[myristic acid]]
	- [[oleic acid]]
	- [[linoleic acid]]
