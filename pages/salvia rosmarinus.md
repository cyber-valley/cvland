- ### review of the salvia rosmarinus
- [[salvia rosmarinus]], formerly known as [[rosmarinus officinalis]] and commonly called [[rosemary]], is a [[perennial]], [[woody herb]] native to the mediterranean region. it is widely cultivated for [[culinary]], [[medicinal,]] and [[ornamental]] purposes, and it plays a valuable role in regenerative and [[permaculture]] systems due to its [[drought resistance]] and [[insect-repelling]] properties.
- [[salvia rosmarinus]] is a hardy, multipurpose plant that supports [[food systems]], [[herbal medicine]], [[insect control]], and [[biodiversity]]. ideal for [[dry climates]] and [[edge plantings]] in [[herb spirals]] or [[orchards]] understories, [[rosemary]] is one of the most useful [[herbs]] in sustainable design.
- **parts of the plant and their uses:**
	- **root**: the roots are not commonly used in products, but they support the plant in dry, rocky soils and contribute to [[erosion control]] in [[permaculture]] designs.
	- **stem**: woody stems are sometimes used as [[aromatic skewers]] for grilling or dried for [[fuel]] or [[kindling]]. mature stems can be used in [[crafting]] or [[tools]] handles.
	- **fruit**: [[rosemary]] produces small nutlet-like [[seeds]], but the fruits are not used commercially.
	- **leave**: the most [[valuable]] part of the plant. [[rosemary]] [[leaves]] are used fresh or dried for cooking, [[herbal]] [[teas]], [[essential oils]], and [[traditional medicine]]. they contain powerful [[aromatic]] compounds with [[antimicrobial]] and [[anti-inflammatory]] effects.
	- **bark**: the bark is not used specifically, but the woody portions of the stem carry similar [[aromatic]] and [[medicinal]] properties as the rest of the plant.
	- **flower**: small pale blue to purple flowers are [[edible]] and can be used fresh in [[salad]], as [[garnish]], or [[teas]]. they also [[attract pollinators]].
- **uses of salvia rosmarinus:**
	- **plants/fruits**: not used.
	- **plants/greens**: the young green stems and leaves are used as [[herbs]] in cooking and for [[tea]] infusions.
	- **plants/flowers**: [[edible]] flowers used for [[decoration]], mild [[teas]], and [[pollinator]] attraction.
	- **plants/resins**: [[rosemary]] does not produce resin, but its [[essential oil]] is a highly [[aromatic]] compound extracted from [[leaves]] and [[flowers]].
	- **plants/timber**: [[woody]] stems used for [[skewers]], [[crafts]], or as natural [[fire starter]].
	- **plants/medicine**: used for [[memory enhancement]], [[digestion]], [[joint pain]], [[respiratory issues]], and as an [[antimicrobial]] agent. both [[oil]] and [[tea]] have traditional [[therapeutic]] applications.
	- **plants/fuel**: dried stems and branches can be used as [[kindling]].
	- **plants/fertilizer**: trimmings and spent plant matter can be [[compost]]ed or used as [[aromatic]] [[mulch]] to [[deter pests]].
- **data:**
	- **sun requirements**: [[full sun]], thrives with 6–8 hours of direct [[sunlight]] daily.
	- **water requirements**: low once established, [[drought-tolerant]] prefers dry to moderately moist [[soil]].
	- **soil ph**: prefers slightly alkaline to neutral soils (ph 6.5 to 7.5).
	- **plant/roles in [[permaculture]] guilds**: [[rosemary]] is an excellent companion plant. it [[repels]] many pests, including [[cabbage]] [[moths]] and [[mosquitoes]], and [[attracts bees]] and other [[pollinators]] when flowering. it can be planted as a [[border]] around gardens, [[herb]] spirals, or [[orchards]]. it also stabilizes dry, sloped soils and helps [[reduce erosion]]. pairs well with plants that prefer dry, sunny conditions and benefits from minimal competition.
	- **height in meter**: typically 0.5 to 1.5 meters, occasionally up to 2 meters.
	- **spacing in meter**: 0.5–1 meter spacing is sufficient for air circulation and growth.
	- **germination days**: 14–28 days. slow and irregular germination. propagation is often done via cuttings for reliability.
	- **strata**: [[herbaceous–shrub]] layer.
	- **days to maturity**: 80–100 days from transplant to usable harvest for leaves. full bush maturity in 1–2 years.
	- **plant, harvest, pruning calendar in months**:
		- **planting**: spring (march–may) or fall in warm climates.
		- **harvest**: year-round in warm climates; best in late spring and summer when oil concentration is highest.
		- **pruning**: light pruning throughout the year; major shaping in spring after frost danger has passed.
	- **good neighbors**: [[thyme]], [[sage]], [[lavender]], [[oregano]], [[beans]], [[carrots]], [[cabbage]], and [[fruit trees]].
	- **bad neighbors**: avoid planting near [[mint]] or [[basil]] (which prefer wetter soil), and keep distance from heavy [[feeders]] like [[tomatoes]].
