- terpenoids (also known as isoprenoids) are a large, diverse class of organic compounds derived from [[isoprene]] units, widely produced by plants, fungi, and some animals. terpenoids serve important ecological roles, including plant defense against herbivores, pathogens, and environmental stresses, as well as attracting pollinators.

- ## chemical properties
	- chemical structure: composed of repeating five-carbon isoprene units (C₅H₈)
	- classes: monoterpenoids (C₁₀), sesquiterpenoids (C₁₅), diterpenoids (C₂₀), triterpenoids (C₃₀), tetraterpenoids (carotenoids, C₄₀)
	- solubility: generally insoluble in water; soluble in organic solvents
	- volatility: varies significantly; monoterpenes are often volatile aromatic compounds
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- possess diverse pharmacological activities including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, anticancer, antiviral, and antimicrobial effects
	- widely used in traditional and modern medicine for their therapeutic properties (e.g., [[artemisinin]], a sesquiterpenoid used as antimalarial drug)
	- common terpenoids include [[menthol]] (analgesic, cooling), [[limonene]] (anti-inflammatory), [[carotenoids]] (antioxidants), [[taxol]] (anticancer drug)
- ## [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- terpenoids exhibit potent antimicrobial activities by disrupting microbial cell membranes, inhibiting growth, and interfering with microbial enzymes
	- bacteria:
		- [[staphylococcus aureus]]
		- [[escherichia coli]]
		- [[pseudomonas aeruginosa]]
		- [[salmonella spp.]]
	- fungi:
		- [[candida albicans]]
		- [[aspergillus flavus]]
	- viruses:
		- [[herpes simplex virus]]
		- [[influenza virus]]
