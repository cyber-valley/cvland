- omega-3 fatty acids are polyunsaturated fatty acids essential for human health, characterized by their first double bond at the third carbon from the methyl end. they play crucial roles in maintaining [[cardiovascular health]], [[reducing inflammation]] [[supporting neurological function]], and improving overall metabolic well-being. humans must obtain certain omega-3s through diet, as the body cannot synthesize them naturally.
- ## chemical properties
	- **main types**:
		- [[alpha-linolenic acid (ala)]]: plant-derived, essential
		- [[eicosapentaenoic acid (epa)]]: marine-derived, anti-inflammatory
		- [[docosahexaenoic acid (dha)]]: marine-derived, essential for brain function
	- solubility: insoluble in water; soluble in organic solvents and fats
	- structure: polyunsaturated chains with multiple cis double bonds
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- omega-3 fatty acids significantly reduce [[inflammation]], contributing to improved [[cardiovascular health]] by lowering triglycerides, regulating cholesterol, and reducing blood pressure.
	- [[dha]] is vital for neurological development, supporting cognitive function, vision, and protecting against age-related cognitive decline and [[neurodegenerative disorders]].
	- omega-3s also support mental health, reducing symptoms associated with depression, anxiety, and mood disorders.
- ## [[antimicrobial]] and therapeutic activity
	- omega-3 fatty acids exert indirect antimicrobial effects through anti-inflammatory mechanisms, immune modulation, and inhibition of microbial biofilm formation.
	- bacteria:
		- [[staphylococcus aureus]]
		- [[streptococcus pneumoniae]]
		- [[escherichia coli]]
	- fungi:
		- [[candida albicans]]
	- viruses:
		- [[influenza virus]]
