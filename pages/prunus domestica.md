- ### review of the prunus domestica
- [[prunus domestica]], commonly known as the european plum, is a deciduous [[fruit]] tree cultivated in temperate climates worldwide. it is valued for its [[sweet]] and tart [[fruit]], which can be eaten fresh or dried into [[prunes]]. the tree also plays a useful role in temperate [[agroforestry]] and home orchards.
- [[prunus domestica]] is a valuable [[fruit]] tree in temperate climates, offering [[sweet]] fruits, useful [[wood]], and support for [[biodiversity]]. it works well in mixed [[orchards]] and [[food forests]] when integrated with supporting species that [[improve soil]], [[repel pest]]s, and [[attract pollinators]].
- **parts of the plant and their uses:**
	- **root**: the roots stabilize the tree and support [[nutrient uptake]]. in some traditions, root bark has been used for [[herbal extracts]], though it’s not common.
	- **stem**: the woody stem provides [[structural support]] and [[yields]] hard, dense [[wood]] that can be used for [[tools]], [[carving]], or small [[crafts]].
	- **fruit**: the main [[edible]] part. plums are consumed [[fresh]], [[dried]] (as prunes), or processed into [[jams]], [[jellies]], [[sauces]], [[wine]], and [[baked]] goods. rich in [[vitamins a]] and [[vitamin c]], [[fiber]], and [[antioxidants]].
	- **leave**: leaves are not commonly used for [[food]], but are sometimes applied externally in [[folk medicine]] for [[skin irritations]].
	- **bark**: bark from young stems may be used in [[decoctions]] for treating [[inflammation]] and [[digestive issues]].
	- **flower**: small white or pale pink flowers are used decoratively and occasionally in [[herbal tea]] for [[calming effects]].
- **uses of prunus domestica:**
	- **plants/fruits**: the plum [[fruit]] is a major product in [[fresh]], [[dried]], and processed forms.
	- **plants/greens**: not used as greens.
	- **plants/flowers**: sometimes used in [[teas]] or as edible [[garnish]], though not common.
	- **plants/timber**: [[wood]] is hard and fine-grained, used in [[carving]], [[tools]] handles, and small [[furniture]] pieces.
	- **plants/medicine**: plums and prunes are traditionally used to [[relieve constipation]], support [[liver health]], and provide [[antioxidants]]. bark and leaves are used in [[folk medicine]] for [[minor ailments]].
	- **plants/fuel**: [[wood]] from prunings and dead limbs is suitable for [[firewood]].
	- **plants/textile**: not used for fiber or textile purposes.
	- **plants/fertilizer**: fallen leaves and pruned branches can be used as [[compost]]. fruit waste can enrich [[compost]] or be fed to [[livestock]].
- **data:**
	- **sun requirements**: [[full sun]] (6–8 hours daily) is essential for healthy fruit production.
	- **water requirements**: moderate; requires [[consistent moisture]], especially during fruit formation. avoid waterlogging.
	- **soil ph**: prefers slightly acidic to neutral soil (ph 6.0–7.0).
	- **plant/roles in permaculture guilds**: prunus domestica fits well into temperate forest gardens as a [[mid-strata]] [[fruit tree]]. it provides seasonal [[shade]], supports [[pollinators]] when flowering, and adds leaf litter. companion planting with [[nitrogen fixers]] (like [[clover]] or [[goumi]]), [[dynamic accumulators]] (like [[comfrey]]), and [[pest-repelling]] [[herbs]] (like [[chives]], [[garlic]], or [[mint]]) is beneficial. it’s sensitive to [[fungal]] diseases, so airflow and [[fungal companions]] (like [[chamomile]]) are helpful.
	- **height in meter**: typically 3–7 meters depending on cultivar and pruning.
	- **spacing in meter**: 4–6 meters between trees is ideal for air circulation and access.
	- **germination days**: seeds take 60–90 days to germinate after cold stratification; grafting or cuttings are more commonly used.
	- **strata**: [[mid-strata]] [[fruit tree]].
	- **days to maturity**: grafted trees begin fruiting in 3–5 years; seedlings take longer (5–8 years).
	- collapsed:: true
	  
	  **plant, harvest, pruning calendar in months**:
		- **planting**: late winter or early spring (february–april) or fall in mild climates.
		- **pruning**: winter (dormant season) and light summer thinning.
		- **harvest**: depending on variety, typically july to september.
	- **good neighbors**: grows well with [[clover]], [[garlic]], [[comfrey]], [[borage]], and [[nitrogen-fixing]] [[shrubs]]. benefits from [[pollinator]]-attracting [[herbs]] and good airflow.
	- **bad neighbors**: avoid planting near [[black walnut]] ([[allelopathic]]), or plants prone to [[fungal]] issues in dense [[shade]] or poor airflow. also avoid overwatering species nearby due to root rot sensitivity.
