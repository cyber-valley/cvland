	- lifecycle
		- longevity:: 30–50 years
		- germination:: seeds germinate in 30–60 days after [[stratification]] (cold treatment). usually grafted for production
		- seedling:: slow in first year, prefers filtered sun and moist, well-aerated soil
		- mature:: begins flowering and fruiting 3–5 years after planting (grafted), with annual harvests
		- death:: productivity declines after 25–35 years; root diseases and borer insects can accelerate death

	- operations
		- [[propagation]]: typically grafted onto rootstock for uniformity and early fruiting. seedlings require stratification
		- [[maintenance]]: annual winter pruning to shape and encourage fruiting wood. [[mulch]] and composting recommended. control [[fungal]] leaf spots
		- [[harvest]]:
			- fruit: harvested when firm-ripe and aromatic, ripening varies with cultivar
			- leaves: used in traditional [[teas]] for constipation and [[blood sugar regulation]]
			- bark: sometimes decocted for [[digestive]] and [[respiratory]] treatments
			- timber: obtained from pruned or old trees, used in small [[woodwork]] and [[tools]]

- ### traditional medicine recipes
  
  **prune decoction for [[constipation]] and [[digestion]]**
	- **ingredients**
		- 5–7 dried prunes
		- 2 cups of water

		- strain and let cool slightly.
		- drink 1 cup in the morning on an empty stomach.
	- **uses**
		- traditionally used as a natural [[laxative]] for [[relieve constipation]]. prunes are rich in [[sorbitol]] and [[dietary fiber]], which promote [[bowel movements]] and [[digestive health]].
- **plum bark tea for [[diarrhea]]**
	- **ingredients**
		- 1 tablespoon of dried plum bark (shredded)
		- 1.5 cups of water
	- **instructions**
		- boil the bark in water for 15 minutes.

		- blend the pulp with 1/2 cup of water until smooth.
		- strain (optional) and drink once daily.
