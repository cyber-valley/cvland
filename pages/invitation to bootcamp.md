	- did you know that this kind of autonomy and freedom could cost about the same as a car?
	- think about it
	- we spend so much on cars that lose value, locking us into routines, limiting our lives to the everyday grind
	- but what if you could invest in a life where you control the rules, the pace, the future!
- scene 3: @joy
	- now, picture your ideal environment
	- a lush, green forest where you feel deeply connected to nature

	- your personal autonomy starts with the basics.
	- energy?
		- the sun is shining, and the wind is blowing,
		- providing you with the power you need—3 to 5 kilowatts per hour
	- water?
		- it’s right there, gathered from the land
		- enough to sustain your home and more
	- and plants?
		- they’re more than just food
		- they give you medicine, heat, timber, textiles and advanced sensations
		- everything you need to live a full life
- scene 6: @master
	- modeling shows that just several species on 500-1000 square meters of land
	- can grow everything you want
	- and will supply energy and water you need
	- this 100% autonomy allows you to focus your attention inward
	- on what truly matters
	- no more chasing after a system that never lets you rest
	- but autonomy isn’t easy—it demands knowledge, skills, and community coordination
- scene 7: @joy
	- that understanding led us to cybervalley
	- and the start of citadel genesis
	- we decided to reengineer nearly everything from the ground up
	- like a tech tree in civilization
	- optimizing technological and cultural processes to live in harmony
	- with the planet, the community, and yourself
