- nitrogen-fixing plants are species capable of converting atmospheric nitrogen (n₂)
- into forms usable by plants, primarily ammonium (nh₄⁺)
- through a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing microorganisms
- commonly rhizobial bacteria in legumes or actinomycetes like frankia in non-legumes
- they play a crucial role in sustainable ecosystems and regenerative agriculture
- by naturally fertilizing the soil, improving fertility without synthetic inputs
