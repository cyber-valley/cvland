- streptococcus species are gram-positive bacteria that are part of the normal flora of humans but can also cause a wide range of diseases. they are classified into several groups based on their hemolytic properties and antigenic characteristics.
	- **diseases caused by streptococcus species:**
		- 1. **streptococcus pyogenes (group a streptococcus):**
			- **[[pharyngitis]] (strep throat):** characterized by [[sore throat]], [[fever]], and [[swollen lymph nodes]].
			- **[[scarlet fever]]:** marked by a [[red rash,]] [[fever]], and [[sore throat]].
			- **[[impetigo]]:** a contagious [[skin infection]] causing [[sores]] and [[blisters]].
			- **[[necrotizing fasciitis]]:** a severe infection causing tissue death, often referred to as "[[flesh-eating disease]]."
			- **[[rheumatic fever]]:** an inflammatory disease affecting the heart, joints, and nervous system, occurring after strep throat or scarlet fever.
			- **[[glomerulonephritis]]:** inflammation of the [[kidney]]'s filtering units.
		- 2. **streptococcus agalactiae (group b streptococcus):**
			- **[[neonatal infections]]:** including [[sepsis]], [[pneumonia]], and [[meningitis in newborns]].
			- **[[urinary tract infections]] (utis):** especially in pregnant women.
			- **skin and soft tissue infections:** particularly in elderly or immunocompromised individuals.
		- 3. **streptococcus pneumoniae:**
			- **[[pneumonia]]:** leading cause of bacterial pneumonia, with symptoms like [[fever]], [[cough]], and [[difficulty breathing]].
			- **[[otitis media]]:** [[middle ear infections]], common in children.
			- **[[meningitis]]:** inflammation of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord, potentially life-threatening.
			- **[[bacteremia]]:** bloodstream infections that can lead to sepsis.
		- 4. **viridans group streptococci:**
			- **[[endocarditis]]:** infection of the i[[nner lining of the heart]], often in individuals with pre-existing heart conditions.
			- **[[dental caries]]:** some species contribute to tooth decay.
		- 5. **streptococcus mutans:**
			- **[[dental caries]] ([[tooth decay]]):** significant contributor to the development of cavities.
	- **habitats and transmission:**
		- **human body:** commonly found in the mouth, throat, intestines, and respiratory tract.
		- **environment:** can survive on surfaces and objects, contributing to transmission.
		- **transmission:** occurs through respiratory droplets (coughing, sneezing), direct contact with infected wounds or sores, and, in some cases, through contaminated food or water.
	- streptococcus infections can range from mild to severe and life-threatening. prevention strategies include good hygiene practices, proper wound care, vaccination (for streptococcus pneumoniae), and timely treatment of infections to prevent complications. treatment typically involves antibiotics, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective management. antibiotic resistance is a concern with some streptococcus species, necessitating careful use of antibiotics.
