- campesterol is a plant-derived [[phytosterol]], structurally similar to cholesterol, found abundantly in vegetable oils, nuts, seeds, legumes, fruits, and grains. it contributes significantly to dietary sterol intake and is recognized for its [[cholesterol-lowering]] effects and [[anti-inflammatory]] properties
- ## chemical properties
	- chemical formula: C₂₈H₄₈O
	- molecular weight: 400.68 g/mol
	- solubility: insoluble in water; soluble in fats, oils, and organic solvents
	- melting point: approximately 157–158°C
	- structure: steroid nucleus similar to cholesterol, differs slightly in side-chain structure
- ## usefulness in medicine
	- lowers [[ldl cholesterol]] levels by competing with dietary cholesterol for intestinal absorption, thus reducing [[cardiovascular disease]] risk
	- demonstrates [[anti-inflammatory]] effects beneficial in managing inflammatory conditions such as [[arthritis]] and [[chronic inflammatory disorders]]
	- possesses potential [[anticancer]] properties, notably against prostate, breast, and colon cancers
	- may support [[prostate health]], specifically reducing symptoms of [[benign prostatic hyperplasia]] (bph)
- ## [[antimicrobial]] activity
	- campesterol exhibits indirect antimicrobial activity primarily by enhancing immune function, reducing inflammation, and creating unfavorable conditions for microbial colonization
	- bacteria:
		- [[staphylococcus aureus]]
		- [[escherichia coli]]
	- fungi:
		- [[candida albicans]]
