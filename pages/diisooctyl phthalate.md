- diisooctyl phthalate (diop or dioctyl isophthalate) is a synthetic [[phthalate ester]] widely used as a [[plasticizer]] to increase the flexibility, transparency, and durability of [[plastics]], particularly in [[polyvinyl chloride]] (pvc) products. it is a colorless, oily liquid with low volatility and is primarily used in industrial and commercial applications.
	- ### chemical and physical properties
		- **compound type**: aromatic diester (phthalate)
		- **molecular weight**: 390.57 g/mol
		- **chemical formula**: **C₂₄H₃₈O₄**
		- **boiling point**: ~385°C
		- **solubility**: insoluble in water; soluble in most organic solvents
		- **appearance**: clear, oily liquid with mild odor
	- ### industrial uses and exposure
		- extensively used as a **plasticizer** in **pvc-based materials** such as cables, flooring, hoses, artificial leather, and coatings.
		- found in products like **adhesives**, **paints**, **sealants**, and **rubber compounds**.
		- used in **medical devices**, although being phased out in favor of safer alternatives due to potential toxicity concerns.
		- exposure occurs mainly through **inhalation**, **ingestion**, or **dermal contact**, especially in occupational settings.
	- ### [[health]] and [[environmental]] concerns
		- studies suggest potential for **endocrine disruption**, particularly affecting reproductive and hormonal systems in animals.
		- **bioaccumulation** is low, but it may persist in **soil** and **sediment**, leading to long-term environmental contamination.
		- regulatory agencies in some countries have restricted or banned its use in toys, childcare articles, and certain packaging.
		- ongoing evaluation for **safer plasticizer alternatives** is encouraging its replacement in many consumer products.
