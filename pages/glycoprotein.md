- a glycoprotein is a molecule that consists of a [[protein]] covalently bonded to one or more [[carbohydrate chains]]. glycoproteins are found throughout the body, especially on [[cell surfaces]] and in [[plasma]], where they play essential roles in [[cell signaling]], [[immune response]], [[coagulation]], and [[cellâ€“cell recognition]]. they are synthesized in the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] and [[golgi apparatus]] of cells.
	- ### chemical properties
		- **structure**: composed of a polypeptide backbone with covalently attached oligosaccharide chains
		- **bond type**: n-linked (to asparagine) or o-linked (to serine/threonine) glycosidic bonds
		- **solubility**: varies widely; many are membrane-bound or secreted
		- **examples**: fibrinogen, immunoglobulins, hormones (like erythropoietin), mucins
	- ### usefulness in biology and medicine
		- glycoproteins are essential in [[immune defense]], especially antibodies and [[major histocompatibility complex (mhc)]] proteins.
		- they function as [[hormones]], [[enzymes]], [[clotting factors]], and [[cell receptors]].
		- changes in glycoprotein structure or levels are associated with diseases such as [[cancer]], [[autoimmune disorders]], and [[viral infections]].
		- used in medicine as [[biologic drugs]], [[diagnostic markers]], and [[vaccine components]].
	- ### [[antibacterial]] and [[antimicrobial]] activity
		- many glycoproteins, especially in mucosal tissues, help trap and neutralize [[pathogens]].
		- [[mucins]], a type of glycoprotein, form a protective barrier and inhibit microbial invasion.
		- antibodies (immunoglobulins), which are glycoproteins, play a direct role in recognizing and neutralizing bacteria and viruses.
